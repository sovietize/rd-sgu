> Up to now, most atheists have simply criticized religion in various ways, but the point is to dispel it
Immediate thought: 'most atheists have simply criticized religion in various ways, but the point is to change it'

> Enter the Street Epistemologist: an articulate, clear, helpful voice with an unremitting desire to help [...] create a better world — a world that uses intelligence, reason, rationality, thoughtfulness, ingenuity, sincerity, science, and kindness to build the future; not a world built on delusion, pretending, [...] pseudoscience, superstition, or a certainty achieved by keeping people in a stupor that makes them pawns [...] because they’re terrified.   [*M 22]
(It's funny how you can take out the references to religion and it still makes sense for things like conspiracy theory cults)


this mention of deepak chopra made me realize — if i'm thinking of the right person? —
one problem with what he was saying was that he proposed a consciousness quotient for everything of any size, but when you compare that to reality, he wasn't thinking about how reality is full of emergent behaviors like quantum phenomena assembling into atoms and atoms assembling into tangible objects like chairs, or quantum phenomena assembling directly into a beam of light

if you don't understand dialectical materialist ideas, it's much easier to become deepak chopra and think that things might work the exact same at all scales rather than small things with one set of characteristics interacting to produce bigger things with different characteristics

[edit:] I think deepak chopra is a dualist? I have no idea who actually said this thing but I do very clearly remember /somebody/ saying it once.   [*dc]


> The word “faith” is a very slippery pig. We need to get our hands on it, pin it to the ground, and wrap a blanket around it so we can have something to latch onto [...]. Malleable definitions allow faith to slip away from critique.   [*M 32]
(True of almost any questionable claim)


> Faith and hope are not synonyms. [...] To hope for something admits there's a possibility that what you want may not be realized.   [*M 38]


> If a belief is based on insufficient evidence, then any further conclusions drawn from the belief will at best be of questionable value. [...] This is because faith does not have a built-in [...] mechanism [...] to be corrected, altered, revised, or modified.   [*M 44-45]
Why a few chunks of Trotskyism maybe should read books like this


This feels like yet another bad framing of sharia law which is not untrue but missing some information   [*M 48]


> Aristotle, while reflecting on the thoughts of Plato and Socrates, argues that for an examined life to emerge we need questions and a hunger to pursue those questions. [...] That is, if you believe you have the truth then why would you seek another truth?

This is supposed to be about religious dogmas, like the rest of the book, but all I can think is that having the ability to create my own research questions and start studying them to find the best answer was a big part of leading me out of center-Liberal social democracy
when I truly had the desire to create a working model of something I didn't understand, there was no need to ask me to read things, I would just try to answer my own questions   [*M 68]


> Socrates [...] prescribed a different kind of interpretative experience, one in which we’re not just finding and confirming our existing biases, but also attacking them. Whenever we have a chance to peek at our prejudices and see our own biases and underexamined assumptions, we have an opportunity to attack those assumptions and to rid ourselves from the presumption of knowledge.   [*M 71]


> In The Big Sort, American sociologist Bill Bishop argues that we cluster in politically like-minded communities (2008). That is, we seek out people and groups with ideologies similar to our own — we like to be around people who value what we value. [...] Clustering thus increases the confidence value that we implicitly assign to a belief — we become more certain our beliefs are true.  [*M 79-80]


> PB: You believe that there’s sufficient evidence to warrant belief in these things, right? [...] so for all evidence-based beliefs, it’s possible that there could be additional evidence that comes along that could make one change one’s beliefs. What evidence would you need to make you change your mind?   [*M 96-97]

> The Danish philosopher Kierkegaard writes that anxiety is a key human experience. Most people are afraid of feeling anxiety [...]. if you want to live a full, meaningful human life [...] Use anxiety [...] as a guide to see where it leads you. [...] let it bring you awareness not only of your ignorance but also of your desire to understand moments in every experience.   [*M 101]


> “Doxastic Attitudes as Belief-Revision Policies” (Baltag, Rodenhäuser, & Smets, 2011)
> “This paper explores the idea that an agent’s ‘information uptake’ (i.e., what she does with some new informational input) depends substantially on her attitude towards the source of information: her assessment of the reliability of the source” (p. 1).   [*M 103]

> Orenstein relates religious belief and church attendance to belief in the paranormal (Orenstein, 2002).
> “There have been numerous calls for upgrading science education in order to combat paranormal beliefs... . However, the effects of education are so small that it appears that values and faith rather than rationality are the driving factors in paranormal belief. [...] Some observers suggest that the legitimacy of science itself is under attack by supporters of the paranormal” (Orenstein, 2002, p. 309).
> In The Believing Brain, American author Michael Shermer [...] argues and I agree, that we need to teach people how to think like scientists   [*M 104]


> Your new role is that of interventionist. Liberator.   [*M 110]

I think we always need to ask, freedom from what? intervention in what?
many people will attempt to present workers' states as some kind of cult that requires an intervention.
but the result of the intervention will be freedom from the obligation to contribute to a civilization, freedom to build proprietary territories on top of existing groups of people (corporations, platforms) at the expense of smaller or better territories and impose arbitrary rules on people in an undemocratic way just because they won't disassociate from the other people in the territory, freedom to wage war on other countries, freedom to view other countries as cultural theme parks rather than real groups of people with actual needs who might benefit from assistance.
we can't support the freedom to not cooperate just for its own sake because it is the freedom to mobilize other people in violent competition against other non-cooperating groups. if it doesn't become war it will still force everyone to use smaller more isolated groups of people for building all the projects of daily life, and make everybody's lives terrible.


> not another shot across the bow in the culture wars   [*M 113]

What are "the culture wars" in this context??? is this meaning to imply that whatever they are they don't matter?
I would think that freeing people from religion is simply a part of freeing people from oppression in general, so if you are freeing people from religion you are in fact "fighting the culture wars".

judging by the surrounding context, maybe what's intended here is that Reason is above and separate from all social conflicts. but it never is.
center-Liberal writers really love to pull this. the Lacanians were doing it too
but I get so tired of the idea of trying to do Reason without social context and the understanding of the inner functioning or history of different social groups. it's actually quite a detrimental idea to let slip into this book because they already mentioned the concept that believers will be suspicious of certain kinds of information sources — an acknowledgement that social context exists and you have to have an understanding of what things look like from inside another group of people in order to change somebody's mind.

my thought is always, if Reason were truly separate from social conflicts, we would have to judge ethics from outside all human cultures from some kind of space alien perspective. otherwise the conclusions we come to using Reason will always be tainted by particular cultures' social conflicts or "culture wars"
what's the objective answer on the Cold War? we could only know if we saw it from a perspective of somebody who had never lived in either region and was only just learning about the "cultures" and social issues of both regions


> when misinformed people, particularly political partisans, were exposed to corrected facts in news stories, they rarely changed their minds.  —Joe Keohane, “How Facts Backfire” (2010)
> People dig themselves into cognitive sinkholes by habituating themselves to not formulate beliefs on the basis of evidence.   [*M 117]

Hang on. so the framing here is that the existence of social context is an anomaly and it should be possible to learn information outside social contexts — social context is corrupting the natural ability to Reason and thwarts our ability to ask people to Reason, rather than being a natural part of the process of communication.
I so hate Liberalism and the way it understands Reason. it feels like not having a theory of dialectics that understands the concept of groups is exactly how we got here to needing this manual to patch the problems with Liberalism
