# "understanding" "marxism"


## II

we have an attempt to describe the French revolution and Victorian England which is not all that convincing to someone who hasn't seen the deeper details of this period

> what motivated Marx to become a critic of capitalism?
completely forgot the part where the economy was collapsing /within his lifetime/ and there was hardly a job for him, so he risked starving himself and his family before the worst of the collapse to take time to do his research because he knew it was going to get worse later
it's shocking how you can put this story on one bookend and the Bolsheviks rebuilding a collapsed economy on the other.   [*TC8]

slavery is described as if nobody has heard of it before and it was just suddenly invented yesterday
there's not a lot of attempt to tie it to even the simple idea of the Roman empire /conquering/ Thrace and taking slaves from there. much less to spatially explain the transatlantic slave trade   [*s1]

I know that the feudalism part is as Marx saw it so I can't bash that one as much
but in feudalism we know there are often 'warring states' periods of nobles owning territories and then when the competition stopped in Europe they created nation-states and the manor system
in China, there were /several/ 'warring states' periods before there was ever the idea to create a nation-state

> [serfs] were born into the social position occupied by their parents


> this result can be expressed by dividing the length of the slaves' working days into two portions
this one is also Marx's fault. but I am finally starting to see a potential crack in this visual metaphor

why does the slaveholder, manor lord, or capitalist get to regulate /any/ of this?
if you look into this question you'll begin to see that the 'necessary' portion acts as a justification for innovation and expanding capitalism spatially further - we won't be able to survive if we don't continuously improve everything in material life as if that's the same as reproducing it - and also for creating the Self-Enslavement that makes people question if resistance to capitalism is sensical or deserving a Capitalist Job is life itself

it's not actually as simple as necessary labor vs surplus labor. there's also the dance you have to do to "deserve" access to be able to do either of them, with potentially all kinds of arbitrary conditions on it, as well as a competition between you and other Job Candidates for the Job Slot.
[edit:] a little bit later I dubbed this combination of things "competitive labor"


> a tiny group of people at the top (major owners and top executives) make all the key decisions
there are at least two giant problems with this statement
1. begins to sound like generic rants about "Elites!" who could easily morph into "organized crime!" or even "Woke blacks and mexicans"   [*gb]
2. ignores the competition between employers for roles in society that gradually forces everyone into more established corporations, including small businesses and government workers

you never realize the biggest problem the United States has with understanding class until you see it here, which is that it isn't a division created /inside/ a corporation but a spatial division of business empires slurping up citizens from their surroundings.
this would be clearer if you understood that slavery has always had spatial implications of slurping up people from surrounding countries. Wolff's method is like ending slavery by turning slave plantations democratic one at a time. which is alarmingly kind of what the US far right generally believes in with "states' rights"


> 135 years since [Marx died] ... every country on the planet includes Marxist organizations ... they all found meaning in Marxism, and they still do.
that argument is a bit weak as far as showing Marxism is correct because you could equally say "every country on the planet includes Trotskyist organizations!". in the 82 years since he died, they all found meaning in Trotskyism...... and still do.


## III

> but not all people work ... surplus ... enables such other people to function
here we need to add to Marx's model that there is now /artificial scarcity of labor/. some people are unable to pass the requirements to get to work, even though they can. and this is used for various different reasons like corporations trying to save on training costs by getting already-connected people, workers/management wanting to create a specific kind of "work culture" (which may not be a good one) and get nobody to question it because they're desperate to just get the first tolerable job somewhere, etc.

the part about using the slave's surplus to reproduce slave society isn't bad. it might be the most insightful part of this
though it does make me begin to wonder if slave plantations produced "competitive labor" of any kind.
nobody was aiming to become a slave obviously. but was there some kind of competitive labor to keep the plantation 'competitive' with other 'enterprises' where it would not sell any products if this wasn't done? I don't know.


> the employer divides that revenue into three portions
see, this is where we get the labor wedges error.
the worker's time is necessary labor, surplus labor, and competitive labor
but the revenue gained is 'necessary' revenue to replace equipment, wages, and profit
it's very easy to conflate them and think the revenue graph also represents divisions of the worker's time, but that's not how it actually goes, because the worker can be used to produce wasteful "innovations" that aren't really innovations, which may sometimes go into another business's 'reproduction' costs for things like proprietary software or special machines - which may require extra labor to buy those things, and represent one business doing some competitive labor and then ratcheting all the others up by that same bit of competitive labor


> Marx's conclusion follows: ... any exploitative production relationship must be excluded.
I bet this doesn't understand what that means

> For a minority to appropriate and distribute the surplus produced by a majority ...
yeah, no, this /very easily/ gets into the idea that you have to immediately tear out central government and "The Bureaucracy" or else you've put workers in wage slavery under the Bolshevik party who are being paid the surplus
which can then potentially be turned into supporting capitalism if people feel that putting everyone in a co-op and preserving the anarchy of production is fairer than allowing there to be a communist party because small groups of people "get to democratically distribute the surplus".


> Marx invented and used his surplus-based concepts of class to explain why previous social critics of grossly unequal distributions of wealth and power had so far been unable to overcome those social injustices

> They had not understood why ending exploitation was necessary ...
now that is a phrase to turn around at everyone who misunderstands Marxism today - including Wolff
I think there's a real problem with his idea that the surplus is the most central part of Marxism. it immediately suggests things like:
* you can abolish corporations one by one if you just pick the minimum unit of exploitation of some capitalists and their workers
* people won't be forced by society to simply make More surplus to compete with other corporations and receive enough revenue to pay themselves a wage. it's not intuitive because sometimes you get that extra effort back in selling something like a $60 videogame that is always expensive because you can always make new sideways "innovations" on gaming computers, though sometimes if e.g. you pay for some proprietary technology that isn't truly necessary to make your product you might not get it back. anyway, it's like the Market is making you work the whole day and produce surplus rather than the boss.


## IV

> Labor power was not a commodity in the slave and feudal economic systems
no... /slaves/ were a commodity, so capitalists were still buying people from another country and forcing them into capitalism. in slavery a country expands into other countries, in capitalism a corporation expands onto the country's own people
there's maybe even a small argument that in feudal periods cities were a kind of trophy so nobles conquering cities were 'obtaining people' for their use as well, though it wasn't as developed as in slavery or capitalism until the manor system

> the more surplus the capitalist can get ... the more funds the capitalist has to consume, grow, compete and secure the system that puts the capitalist on top
finally we're getting to competition
the co-op can't necessarily appropriate surplus to any particular person, but it has to contend with the other businesses growing and growing and buying other businesses and having completely exclusive technology and becoming its vendors and variously threatening the whole revenue and "surplus" of the co-op


## V

> as earlier societies had made the inequalities resulting from slavery and feudalism matters caused by nature or God, in capitalism strong ideological tendencies make inherent individual variability the cause

I don't like this because it seems like an oversimplification

just for starters, you get into the Lysenko vs Marjorie Taylor Greene debate — if there aren't people who are natural managers /and/ there aren't people who are natural experts at something, do we risk Lysenko or Greene getting the role because we falsely assumed it was too easy, and if we ban Greene for being just too plain awful as well as not knowing anything, how do we know where to draw the line in order to not recreate an elitist society as existed with the "career paths" of capitalism
basically how do you "educate a Lysenko" without putting them under ridiculous pressure to be the best ever. 
you can't do it under Wolff's Dengist line that "it's not markets or planning, you can have socialist markets and capitalist planning" (I heard a known Dengist attribute this same idea to Deng Xiaoping.) [*cc1]
the 'socialist markets' of china factually put a whole lot of pressure on people, and also feed regressive social values that 'critical race theorists should just go do research and development for a corporation', which would be disastrous for the United States where there are already nazis  [*cc2]


> capitalists distribute surpluses ... to increase the scale of production ... to cover costs of relocating production to lower wage areas ... to retain lawyers ... to shareholders
good
the issue I've found is that it's not surplus in all of these. mainly in upgrading production

> deep suspicions of one another ... keep capitalists from overcoming the systemic unevenness
as will happen to co-ops if we try to create a bunch of equal small businesses. they won't necessarily coordinate together


> each capitalist guesses differently ...
> 'developed' and 'undeveloped' areas proliferate and even sometimes replace one another

this paragraph is a lot to unpack.
it seems like an understanding of the idea that capitalism and "Global North"/"Global South" are intertwined. 
but it also fails to understand the idea of Industry Blobs and that corporations are competing for social roles, so the "unevenness" doesn't necessarily happen because the corporation is 'undemocratic' or a /capitalist/ 'guessed wrong', but because the problem of generally /figuring out how to build an industry/ is always hard and the co-ops could also make 'wrong guesses' or build the wrong hierarchy of corporations to create an industry that adequately solves the problem it would like to solve
building civilization is really hard and it's not necessarily the capitalists' fault we can't come together to build the correct things we need, because that task really takes /all/ of us, all the citizens and all the "co-ops" at once.
I guess the conclusion is that "democracy" (in the Liberal sense) and "cooperation toward a goal" are different things, and we really need cooperation between different groups of people instead of separate people separately doing things, which very easily becomes competitive simply because you can't coordinate your activities and have to reduplicate effort, which turns into competition over the same task

damn, I think I figured out why China confuses me. in a few ways it's really aiming to discover what cooperation looks like as opposed to a competitive vision of economic democracy, but it's just very unclear if it's getting to its goal.


[edit 4-07:]
after thinking about all this for a long time it finally hit me where the fundamental error is in Wolff's descriptions of Marx's labor wedges.
the point of the wedges is not that the boss is appropriating labor and it should go the boss's employees.
the point of the wedges is that we need to devote a wedge to /holding the overall society together/. it doesn't matter what specific form that takes, but what matters is that businesses contribute something back to the society that spawned them rather than draining resources away from it and using them for some arbitrary purpose.
the real exploitation of capitalism occurs in businesses draining away workers' energy and resources from /efforts to help others/. if workers could come home from a 4-hour workday and help others get a job or a house capitalism would not be as objectionable as it is right now. but we cannot even help others because we are so busy producing wasted effort that nobody needs, or maybe because we're so isolated.
if co-ops don't understand that the purpose of taking back the wedges is to hold the society together and prevent giving people reasons to fight each other and tear each other down, it could create a very uneven economy where we're doing perfect on some things co-ops thought were important but have no resources to support some other thing like healthcare or public transit that nobody created a co-op for yet


## VI

> Another remarkable quality of Marx ... contradictions
this idea comes completely out of nowhere in this text, totally disconnected from the notion of Materialism and building hypotheses about concrete reality.


> they usually seek and find counteracting tendencies
I feel like "counteracting" is a really bad way to word this because it suggests the idea that all resistance movements are Marxism, James Lindsay style — feminism is Marxism, anti-racism is Marxism, just because they're resisting some typical trend in society and/or predicting possibilities for what the future could look like.

we have such nasty misconceptions about Marxism and it's like, entirely necessary to explain all of them just for your introduction to Marxism to not encourage nazism and labeling everything Marxism while appropriating ideas like 'a small minority' that gets morphed into The Liberal Black Trans Mexican Elite


> in Hegel's view, everything is contradictory
not a nitpick for this text, but I'm now really beginning to think about "Anti-Oedipus" and the basically, really weird dialectic they were creating where society's "Bodies Without Organs" (mechanical corporate bodies, non-cooperating groups of people, something in that vein?) were each competing for their own goals without considering anything else, and this was a bad thing that meant we had to resist the BWOs somehow

it's kind of like Deleuze and Guattari were only-very-accidentally on to something, by accidentally sketching out the notion of All vs All in capitalist society... but they didn't necessarily have a solution to it any better than syndicalists' and Libertarians' "resist the 1%". as far as I'm concerned, "going back to an undifferentiated state" is basically the same as "revert capitalism to an earlier phase of it" in practice


> both these wage-reduction mechanisms entail contradictions as displaced wage-earners resent and resist


> no sooner do capitalists succeed in paying lower wages and/or hiring fewer workers, than ... workers may now have less income ... they will be less able to buy

this seems like another point in Marx that is actually weakened by the focus on Ricardian economics because it doesn't look at the full picture
the way we experience this in daily life looks kind of like capitalists building up their own private civilization and trying to convince us it's ours when it isn't
capitalists build up these huge privatized structures like all Google or Amazon's buildings and equipment and subsidiaries. they create exclusive and almost secret technologies that they parade to us but nobody gets to examine closely and maybe few people even get to use. they create "services" which they entirely control but they want everyone to use, such as Adobe's cloud applications, or YouTube or Twitter becoming so big everyone has to use it for its particular use instead of something else, but the corporation has all the control over it. and of course, so-called "intellectual property" where capitalists extract labor from people to random employers to access knowledge and they really punish any individual scapegoat that seems to be genuinely challenging it

capitalists want to take as much of Everything as possible and leave as little of Everything for workers as possible but they know there would be more resistance if people didn't get a teeny limited access to civilization, so they offer you really difficult opportunities to get into civilization and be able to access things like a vast comprehensive library or exclusive technology or the opportunity to innovate. but only the teeniest teeniest slice of access to contribute to industry and access to the benefits of what industry has produced because each capitalist has to compete over all that and hide it from the others to make money

however in order to end capitalism we have to replace this shitty fake civilization (corporations) composed of a capitalist giving us limited access to private civilization (industry) with another civilization
if co-ops don't give us a great "place to live" where we can access more of civilization and experience fewer cases of civilization being waved in front of our faces "buy!! or gigantic penalties if you find some way to unofficially share instead", they cannot end capitalism and all the problems of capitalism.

honestly. I think there may be an argument that under capitalism cooperation across various groups of people (writers from another ideology, art creators or small businesses from a minority ethnicity, etc) is almost /sold/ to us for labor in a sense, because of this notion that it always sells /access/ to civilization and you never really "vote with your wallet", you only gain access to some capitalist thing that may be good or shitty and you have no idea.
the wide access to knowledge on things like Wikipedia, YouTube talks, online Marxist archives — or in any unofficial methods of sharing existing art and information that turn up — really makes you see how in capitalism all interactions between different groups of people being purchases limits those interactions and limits discourse because you won't go out of your way to associate with distant groups of people whose Products aren't "worth the money"


> For Marxists, no law, rule, regulation or behavior pattern provides an escape from this contradiction
if only Wolff would realize this and reconsider Dengism
this whole problem became super clear in analyses where economists (notably even Liberal ones) saw the rate of profit falling to zero over time, basically the whole thing breaking open at the end of the graph   [*HSC1]


> every four to seven years on average ... capitalism produced an economic downturn

> any individual exhibiting a personal instability comparable to the economic and social instability of capitalism would long ago have been required to seek professional help

this line was always funny, but.... I think it's actually sadly wrong looking at the facts
we have so many QAnon followers and people who are completely out of their mind, but there's an increasing resistance by a broad swath of people to having to "require them to seek professional help" or even cooperate with society on other basic things like vaccines because we're having a giant battle over what's a "negative freedom" and what's an unreasonable demand that harms society.
the United States will not only put up with unstable individuals but allow everything to turn into a war of which groups of individuals control their local communities no matter how delusional or hateful or murderous the individuals may be.

let's not forget that Wolff tried to hijack this and get people to resist vaccine mandates, in order to in effect fence more control of society inside corporations and take it away from Liberal democracy   [*w]
he thought it was better for corporations to make special agreements to encourage workers to get vaccinated, when this isn't even turning the corporations into co-ops and changing "how the surplus is divided", it's just taking control from the United States and putting it inside the United States' corporations.

we really need to start understanding the resistance to federal regulations as a transformation where corporations are slurping up government, even if their internal single-corporation unions are doing it "nicely".


# VII

> Marx never suggested ... that the state had to play some sort of ongoing, central role
oh boy. citation needed.

I think I already have a small piece of evidence against this: Marx talked about how forming a republic and moving out of theocratic monarchy was important to creating "citizens" _per se_ and giving people of different religions equal rights.  [*j]
you could say he saw the importance of the state in creating specifically a democratic republic with a parliament - the new government had to abolish establishment of religion, this was not negotiable, to create a new phase of things where people could be free to practice their religion or express a particular heritage without the previous government framing what they are considered to be in that state and who the "default person" is.

lined up against the United States..... it certainly makes the "any freedom is good freedom" line look bad when it's fed into an effort to take away decisions about civil rights /which were put in place because the United States previously didn't allow those things/. marx said the United States was in a better place than his country for having federal rights, and now we want to take them away, even though /Marx said/ that not having particular rights within civil society is not an excuse to let the state refuse to provide them formally. you don't let the state refuse to provide Jewish rights just because they don't functionally exist inside capitalism. but this is almost exactly the error being made here.
bill of rights is bad, government defines oppressions by mentioning them, anarchy explodes oppressions immediately rather than perpetuating whatever problems previously existed until they're solved Somehow

> ongoing
I think the craziest part of this for me is that this word "ongoing" implies that 10 years of a communist government is "ongoing" even if we imagine it magically completed its whole task after 10 years and then proceeded to dissolve - that would be too much for Wolff. he needs it gone immediately.

at that rate he's abandoning the principles of Liberalism. he may as well experiment with actually telling people federal rights are a bad idea and co-ops individually giving people trans rights and the rights of immigrants and black people to exist is the future. it would be insane and a bit offensive but at least it would be consistent and we would be able to have an honest discussion about why we created Liberal states in the first place


> he never wrote a book about the state
I think the most telling thing is this implication that only what somebody /wrote/ is important and the context they lived in and the events happening then are totally unimportant
the way I look at it it's like
1. german economy is gradually entirely collapsing
2. Marx writes Capital
3. german economy totally collapses for kind of predictable reasons
4. bolsheviks rebuild collapsed russian civilization and shortly pick up marx's task to try to stop the spread of fascism

also Marx talked about parties. why did he bother with parties if he was an anarchist. why didn't he create some kind of economic organization to undermine the SPD instead of there being the KPD

let me make up one of these. Stalin never wrote a book about... intersectionality. so he did not believe in getting different identity groups to work together. but he did, because he believed in separating nationalities from the Russian Empire and federating them into the Soviet Union.
Lacan never wrote a book about.... democracy, so he did not want political Lacanianism to use democracy to achieve its aims.


> a minority of people ... decide what gets produced, how
no. the Market decides what gets produced, and large corporations also shape the Market by dominating it and attempting to manipulate people's preferences
the Market only actually exists in the competition between corporations over the same space of a particular role and particular people's money, but "All vs All" is critical to understanding the decision on "what gets produced"
imagine an economy that really believed in negative rights... corporations just wouldn't tread over other corporations and jobs and maybe there would be federations of industry joined democratically or something


> There has to be a fundamental change in how production gets done: at the office, ... or home
I think this is meaning remote work,
but my first thought was that this was talking about a family's domestic work to reproduce itself and how Engels explained "women's work" and the origins of patriarchy. and I thought, what the hell do co-ops do for this??? is this gonna morph into some kind of nazi argument about how other families are appropriating the surplus??

> the decisions at the workplace ... must be made democratically ... on the basis of one-person, one vote
it took me quite some time to see this, but I feel like there's a way for this to turn ineffective based on material factors
it won't be a capitalist having all the influence on how the vote turns out or anything.
but my top thought is the way that the United States created a whole system to mediate forming unions but then bosses would always try to influence the "union election" so people wouldn't vote for a union


> After all, ridding ourselves of kings, czars and emperors ...
in the era of republics, a lot of oppression is carried out in groups as a whole system, not as single people acting like dictators. even Donald Trump gained his power from enabling a bunch of people throughout society who wanted to act oppressively.
so a republic is a contest between different parties or goals, where a bad goal can ripple through society in waves. a co-op could easily be corrupted in the same way.
I think in the end the most democratic array of co-ops probably couldn't put off fascism if the larger society is rippling with waves of fascism where one group of people has decided they need to compete with another group of people for society.


> socialization of the means of production will not get us beyond capitalism insofar as it retains the employer
thanks Trotsky
no, this is not why that's done. it's to take out existing power structures and possibly nationalist parties so they can't snowball into bigger and bigger destroyers of democracy as they own more stuff
and what it achieves is limited, I mean people can still try to hijack the communist party or something, but it does make it impossible to have Fox News as this unofficial party media outlet that's also somebody's business and broadcast hateful rhetoric at millions of people to get more money and more influence

> Capitalism is superseded when the workplace relationship designated by the term exploitation ends.
that one might actually be true.
but the implication is that you have to be in control of /all/ the labor wedges to get rid of class society.
so the competitive labor to produce e-waste and exclusive technologies can't be mandatory any more, nor can we have, say, people forced into the oil industry because they need a job but don't actually want to destroy the climate.


> Marx's [idea] is a more formal and fuller statement of one version of these ideas.
this is such a statement because it's so empty.
it's like, anything could be "one version of these ideas". Kautsky's opinions could be one version of these ideas.


marx teaches co-ops in a systematic, theoretically sophisticated way....



I think I need to expressly put in "Marx alone does not give us the key to understanding Brexit and Trump"
or, the employer-employee relationship
