what has happened to china?
well, the same thing

wage workers and small owners have been combined into a new class of Miscellaneous Professionals

every Professional is forced to compete against other individuals for territory - productive property and a place to Settle within the European Town although everywhere is already marked for something
likewise we have nobody to really run services except for this territory system
in the struggle to simply be a worker or keep society running, we are all forced into the competition of structure against structure for territory


however this suggests that territories can be filled with non-profit structures to stem the competition to wastefully produce more and more and keep it from everyone
