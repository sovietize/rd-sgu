dialectics as an atomic model of society - anecdote

rothenberg and žižekians attempted to create a "model of the social" based on conceiving of society as a bunch of interacting individuals
i didn't have a big problem with the basic idea of this
but the direction they took it and the conclusion they drew was completely useless
it was something like, society is nothing more than a network of interacting individuals.... but with this we should do absolutely nothing because individuals are not truly related to anything around them and move seemingly randomly.
in a way they almost declared that the social connections between individuals are illusory and society is necessarily solipsistic

nucleons are not self-contained, isolated objects.
one might visualise them - though this may not be a highly accurate model - as fuzzy tangles of energy whose quarks do not stay fully contained. look at an image of the sun, and you will see that while it is mostly spherical, it is not a perfect sphere and has a number of phenomena on its surface like solar flares which interact with the surrounding universe.


as the three quarks interact with each other, they create a physical interaction between them called a gluon.
the gluon is another fundamental particle like a quark, electron, or photon, but also much like a photon, it can act as a unit of energy transferred from one use of energy to another.
in a chloroplast, a photon hits a pigment molecule, it adds its quantum of energy to an electron, and the electron with excess energy moves to other parts of the chloroplast to create energy storage molecules which can flow through the cells of the plant to power other chemical reactions.
[this is too much information]
