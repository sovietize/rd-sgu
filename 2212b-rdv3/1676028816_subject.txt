smash the subject


'the revolutionary subject' is a dumb idea
it took me a while to finally realize this was a problem or that it needed any attention - how is this idea hurting anyone? isn't it just a phrase used to describe theories?
but only after I saw somebody try to refute Marxism by saying it had the "wrong subject" /two separate times/ did I finally start to see the problem.

it is very common to try to reduce Marxism to a theory where some very narrow group of factory workers is The Subject and there are incredibly specific things they're supposed to do and if these specific people can't achieve these specific things Marxism has failed because this was the only possibility


Lacanians are notable for getting extremely obsessed with "subjects" and actually devoting time to exploring how The Subject is constructed in various theories and what all the possible definitions of The Subject could be
of course, they have eventually come to the position that only the individual person and individuality itself can serve as The Subject in their theories, and any other definition of The Subject is bad and will cause trouble

Bookchin is another theorist who subtly made this mistake
eventually he produced an analysis of revolutions in which he corrected his own error in explaining that the French revolution and the Russian revolution were each an event involving broad masses of people rather than hinging on a particular section of them


Lenin in fact explains the necessity to take Bolshevism to all strata of society and turn it into a movement criticizing the entire society, in contrast to the trade union movements of his time which only focused on the industrial workers


both in theory and in fact Marxism has no need for The Subject
it should be understood as an analysis of all the interactions across the entire society and what major goal that entire society needs to have - usually, mobilize as many people as possible against capital
