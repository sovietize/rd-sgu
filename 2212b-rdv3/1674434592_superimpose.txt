disconnected organs in the shape of a body

(a roadmap thingy i guess)



reconnecting civilization is the problem

disorganized pieces not coming together
the whole BWO thing is almost a good metaphor even though that framework is stupid and explains nothing by itself
we build these pieces of civilization outward unconsciously but they don't line up and civilization falters and breaks and dies

connection struggle is long term problem, class struggle is smaller problem (!) on top of it
once you get a workers' state you have to fix the connection struggle



suburbs are the awfullest "BWO problem"
they are purely one part of civilization advancing past the other parts, building a bunch of houses without jobs or transport or anything the people actually need except houses



how do we know this
marxism-leninism creates workers' states but then the problems of Liberal and communist countries start to converge
this is whether the country descends into revisionism or not.
there is a persistent wrong belief in places like the United States that this means there is no need for revolution and it's a distraction, while really what happened is everything is held up by capitalism and now the overall long-term process of building the country is able to continue

it may be that civilization is not something that gets better and better exponentially as much as something that can be functional or dysfunctional, analogous to a human body
we generally do not try to make better and better humans that get exponentially better, but rather come up with ways to maintain a healthy human body. (at least until some hypothetical future time where improving the human body may actually be possible)
that is to say, while individual industries and technologies may get exponentially better, the process of managing civilization is more a process of getting groups of people - such as industries, trade unions, or ideological factions - to work together in a functional or balanced way, independent of the internal achievements of each group



we have to superimpose pieces of civilization back onto each other

the process of organizing people to resist capitalism and the process of repairing civilization from the damage of capitalism are basically parts of the same continuous process of building civilization
we will always need to connect people together into social circles, industries, units of democracy, and cohesive geographical regions which are at peace with themselves rather than erupting into struggles for control as in the right-wing insurgencies of the United States

there are convenient and inconvenient things about this.
it's convenient that we can theoretically continue the process before capitalism is defeated, if very slowly and possibly causing big problems for later - see suburbs
it's inconvenient that putting civilization together becomes harder and harder as it tears apart and becomes more dysfunctional and less able to provide for itself. the "heat death of society"
it's inconvenient that until we clear away roadblocks like capitalism we can't see what's contributing toward the future and what's an error that takes away from the future in the way we would be able to if this wasn't consuming our attention


whenever we don't pay enough attention to superimposing civilization and knitting it together we create "civilization errors" which can be very costly to fix






when civilization is functioning sufficiently well for a long enough period of time, you eventually see the rise of voluntary work
this is a good thing. it should not be re-enclosed into private property
however, voluntary work needs to be coordinated together to integrate it into civilization so that people can build off each other's contributions
you need to, for instance, support one voluntary project as the backbone of many others
if it is not coordinated, voluntary work can become wasted or fragments of it can become adversarial to each other, again ultimately wasting it since capitalism can take over for both sides. and there is almost no greater waste than wasting voluntary work, basically one of the crowning jewels of human achievement
