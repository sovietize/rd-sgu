탑i탑ek is saying that society is one big ocean of ideas
but you have to step out of the ideas to find what is authentic
this is Dasein all over again

heidegger thought the world was corrupted by technology
bookchin thought the world was corrupted by economies of scale
탑i탑ek thinks the world is corrupted by ideology


this carries the assumption that Dasein is always right
but if you believe Dasein is always right you are not using reason
