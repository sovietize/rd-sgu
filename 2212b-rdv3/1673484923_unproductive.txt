the united states has tried so hard to deny corporate bureaucracies
we have the techno-feudalism conspiracy theory where it's alleged that capitalism turning into large bureaucracies is an unnatural conspiracy
we have a few people who took Trotsky's rants about there being too many bureaucrats and still landlords as some kind of evidence of something

but as capitalism develops here is what we discover
before long we invent all kinds of things that neither paid subscriptions nor taxes could easily support
we invent newspapers, magazines, TV, online newsfeeds like Youtube and Twitter

almost always the way to support these is simply to have another business pay for them through ads
if you try to pay for them through subscriptions, you find the bourgeoisie have all the money, they don't like to pay workers much, people can't pay the subscriptions, and services die until there are just a few services instead of many
if you try to pay for them through taxes, businesses and business owners will eventually evade taxes, or maybe there simply won't be enough taxes for this particular thing
the only real option is to join businesses together so the bigger businesses can pay for the smaller projects directly

we see that the real pattern is that people want to make projects that are not easy to sell or profit from, we are making entire corporations worth of Unproductive Labor, and we have to directly join the Unproductive Labor to Productive Labor in order to pay for it
human beings don't naturally gravitate to systems where they pay for Unproductive Labor all the way across the country if they aren't going to use it themselves. so it is a difficult sell to simply say, I am going to make a big contribution to the economy but you have to pay for it whether you're going to use it, and then it's free
although in some cases, people will contribute money to projects like Wikimedia Foundation and Internet Archive if they actually use the project regularly. assuming they can pay in the first place

the problem of taxes is avoided if instead of allocating taxes from miscellaneous people to places we are moving jobs to places - moving the source of the income in the first place
this has two possible advantages, that either people who would like to contribute their income to the project choose to work next to it, or alternatively that control of workers' output would be taken away from capitalists by taking away workers themselves




call centers
we want to think that technology is getting easier for individuals to do whatever they want to
but to expand the economy this much always requires a complicated corporate bureaucracy
there is a huge amount of labor to be done and we create proprietary machines to take over part of the labor but whenever people get confused about how to use the machine or there are glitches on the corporate end we end up needing jobs for that and we shove them all into low-paid foreign call centers
if we truly valued "the jobs we will have when machines take over" properly maybe we would decide to spend more money on people who are easy to understand and can get the call done quickly. but what we have is more like a goal to automate away the call centers that is never accomplished

i went through this with prepaid mobile phones
and later with some kind of medicare + medicaid provider. this is basically a government program but the website wasn't working so I had to call them and they sent me to a call center where I got referred across two or three people
after also sending me through an unnecessarily long maze of press 1 press 2 switchboard. it's like we did away with switchboards and telephone operators only to reinvent them as something the caller would operate

there's not really a lot of distinction between corporate services and US government services any more. US civilization has turned into nothing more than a bunch of interlocking clusters of workers loosely and poorly bound together by money and the need for some task to be done, where we also try to ignore the furthest clusters and claim they've already been innovated away while they actually have not

as it attempts to expand the economy with corporations, china really ought to think ahead and think about how this "call center problem" can be avoided
