for side section on art: story depth


why are linear non-interactive stories usually the first thing we think of
commodity production.
a linear story can be easily printed hundreds and hundreds of times the same way for everyone
it is simple to create a production schedule to produce a particular finite product


interactive stories sabotage their potential if they attempt to be disposable
disposable is what linear stories are
it can feel very cheap when we made a whole bunch of technology just to convey a story that could really be experienced about as effectively in an older linear medium such as a TV show or comic, and perhaps a TV show with the ability to produce arbitrary things for a single use would even convey it more richly
true interactivity is achieved only when we can modify the story itself and not simply look for more "secrets" in the same disposable story which was already finished a while ago
