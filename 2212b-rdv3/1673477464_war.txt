Private Property as war


"property" is almost just our way of concealing war, rather than taking real steps to end it

this is how it feels when i watch a history of hong kong, taiwan, and macau
it feels pretty arbitrary that there should be any british or portuguese claims to these in the first place,
but once you realize that you begin to think, isn't any nation-state really arbitrary. why do we bother fighting wars over little tiny islands, or these weird posturings.



in a way all "property" is the same

we decided that nation-states were the only way to keep another nation-state from getting that property but war continued and nation-states tried to take pieces away from each other

we decided that corporations were the only way to keep somebody else from bankrupting that business but we have corporate buyouts, we have huge megacorporations "killing" entire industries, microsoft put in deliberate bugs to prevent using a competitor's DOS, we got computers-per-corporation where people got used to games only being sold through specific consoles through specific corporations and the industrial structure of each game console didn't truly compete with the others until one monopoly might decide to buy the others and bring them under its control

and we decided that "intellectual property" was the only way to keep another person from getting that job or income but war continued and there was copyright trolling and people claiming to exclusively own a series they don't own and people finding that their artist job simply doesn't exist because huge corporations and franchises already took the territory and that's what people want them to draw unless they create a self-contained story product that sells extremely well and reach the popularity level of becoming an independent "franchise"

in a way property is just the claim that the antagonism between individuals is natural and there's nothing we can do to get rid of it
