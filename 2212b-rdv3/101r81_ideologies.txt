## ideologies sections

marxism and anarchism are sometimes at odds because both want to organize a labor movement but communism will want to direct the labor movement and anarchism will resist being controlled by the communist party, sometimes it will resist the entire idea of Materialist theories which attempt to suggest possible futures

Liberalism-based theories are the worst because they resist communism /and/ anarchism. an anarchist protest connected to not wanting to be controlled by Liberalism or communism is not considered progress because it isn't maximally inclusive and convincing to bigots
Lacanianism and US syndicalism both suffer from this

in Lacanianism there is a mistaken idea that Marx was trying to "predict history"
you can see where this misconception comes from: referring to the sum of knowledge about previous class struggles as "all of history", Engels having outlined a whole timeline of economic hierarchies, short speculations about possible future stages.
Marx set out to /model/ the general human experience independent of the historical timeline and its possible future timeline, based on shared experiences across different groups of people and time periods.

a "predictive" marx might have done something like insist that people had to plan for the United States and Germany having socialist revolution while they might have to stand up to resistant powers like Russia, or vice versa. however, Marx was open to many possible futures.

this is a disastrous mistake to make, because if we truly believed that using known possibilities from the past to forecast possible futures in order to plan for them was a bad idea, we could all become climate change deniers on the same grounds as rejecting Marxism.
climate scientists create a model based on long-term historical data about the planet's climate in order to understand what kinds of events and trends we already know to be possible on planet earth. similarly, Marx created a model based on what kinds of societies we already knew to be possible, knowing that in his time some countries were industrial but many human societies appeared like they might still go through already-known stages.
the predictions of climate models do not necessarily predict the /inevitable/ future, only a possible future. similarly, if Marx makes a speculation about the future, this is only a guideline for how people might begin to take action, knowing that it's not possible to predict the exact outcome.

skepticism and science concepts

Trotskyism doesn't seem to know what a hypothesis is
we need to always be clear what ideas we come up with are at what confidence level and which ones we are willing to see disproved and replaced with better ones

dialectics are not a scientific theory creator except when they are
dialectical materialism does not create theories, it creates hypotheses
the Socratic dialectic may be considered a model of how we integrate old knowledge and new knowledge together to create scientific theories

many people misunderstand the application of dialectics, claiming that dialectical materialism is a theory generator which predicts the future or creates complete theories of past and present phenomena which do not need to be tested empirically over time to retain the best ideas
this is another disastrous mistake, because it can lead anarchists to abandon the entire idea of hypotheses and models in favor of adventurism
without the ability to build models it is more difficult to "peer review" an anarchist suggestion and prevent wasting effort on a plan that simply will not work and will not result in progress

trotskyism Really needs to stop talking about "sectarians" and "revisionism"
just trash and reject those words/concepts entirely while "Stalinism" continues to use them

"the fourth international" would work vastly better as a Unified Leninism that acts as a hub to get every unionist into unions and every communist into Leninism, and is like, willfully absorbing "Stalinists" and "sectarians" to create a dialectic where everyone simply talks about the actual policies and issues and settles onto the most correct ideas
I think this is the only way you can be "not sectarian" - show that your organization can actually unite people onto workable ideas across sect boundaries and crush sects

it's a shame that even when Trotskyism really tries to just create a "non-sectarian" organization it still ends up fighting sectarian battles for wrong interpretations
I think it should just drop that issue of "sectarianism"/"revisionism" because it's always going to sound dishonest even if it's actually just a matter of uncertainty where people can't collectively decide on what's the right position so Trotskyists have just kind of picked one

however this would have a lot of rhetorical power - why are you Stalinists still arguing about this little thing, get in the fourth international and build worker power on the ground where the revolution actually happens so we can actually win this. sects are dead, the revisionism idea is dead, now we just all build the comintern and find true ideas
