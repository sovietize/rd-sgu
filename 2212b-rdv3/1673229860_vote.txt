democracy begins within social connections



in the united states most of the voting that takes place is secret and oligarchic

we have elections only so often

but many more times a day we have job applications
during a job application process, a business receives hundreds of candidates and one person votes on hundreds of people with less power in society
we don't usually think of it as a vote because usually in a vote there are a lot of voters and a few candidates
however the job candidates are looking to fill a societal position, they state why, and somebody chooses them
it is really just a voting process where there are a thousand candidates and one or two voters whose input is still deemed to be more important than the candidates'.

there is also the stock market
as capitalism goes on and on and profit continues to fall across the board,
it becomes that a lot of startups are not profitable and particularly not consistently profitable, and they need investors and other businesses (advertisers) simply to keep them open
as this happens, it becomes that these businesses and their job positions exist mostly because a group of investors voted for them to exist

in this way capitalism can be understood as a social structure where generally the few vote for the many

whenever you want to contribute to society in capitalism, you must find a small group of people and offer yourself up to them to get accepted or rejected
often with no feedback at all if you get rejected, and only the vague feeling that whatever you do and however overqualified you become is not enough


it is even true to a small extent that bourgeois political parties /vote for their constituents/.
1. gerrymandering - usually at about the level of a US state, the people currently in power redraw voting districts with some particular purpose
2. winner-take-all system / "two-party system" - in order to get their issues heard people must choose a political party but they will face social rejection from others in the same part of society if they don't choose one of the large mainstream options which "can win". local voters exert the pressure that originates from problems at the top of bourgeois parties, but effectively you have to fit in with these flawed candidates to have a vote and the local voters become like some kind of reverse electoral college that votes for which prospective constituents are truly allowed to vote.



bizarrely, "social media" timelines may be very slowly introducing people to real democracy
whatever you post to the world on a newsfeed is subject to masses of people voting for your content in order for it to become accepted and known
you no longer necessarily have to go to some special designated oligarchy that votes for you in order to contribute to society.

but there is still a problem where particular feeds can reach a certain number of followers and create a new oligarchy which is not subject to other people's criticisms and effectively votes for what other regular people are allowed to do because of its influence and ability to pressure these smaller feeds.
in principle, it may be possible to combat this problem with Everyday Democracy, where the popular feeds face consequences for not becoming subject to mutual criticism and cooperation



i suppose the claim here is that democracy is first sociology and not politics
