breaking out of society is not revolutionary



bob black attempts to present the united states' apparent transition toward anarchy as a good thing   [*b]
he tries to tell us people breaking away from politics is a good sign as it follows a natural human disposition away from politics and meetings

however, anybody who has visited the united states should know this is a terrible interpretation of this trend
in england Liberal democracy was created to limit the power of the king
in the united states, Liberal democracy was created to balance the powers of the states against each other within a shared relationship, in an environment where southern states were using their privilege to create large plantations and buy slaves, and wanted to remain sovereign from other states to prevent things like black colleges getting built, or not being able to build "sundown towns", or one day having to provide abortions or spousal rights to same-sex couples
in germany, Liberal democracy was halfway created and then the nazis got mad and destroyed it

in this way, enthusiasm or hatred for democracy conceals the real problem of different regions of people having to interact with each other and decide whether they are allies or enemies and whether they will be part of the same group of humans sharing the same struggle
borders are not just for show; they are an indicator that a previous conflict has ended in that region, peacefully or violently.

so, when people walk away from democracy and retreat from negotiating with other groups of people we should be worried
this can represent people reverting to a state of so much animosity one person is not allowed to walk into the other area or seriously talk about it
in the absence of democracy human beings can turn to an anarchy of civil war where they want no diplomacy or negotiation and only want to kill each other if somebody in one area dares meddle with the other area, or simply at the possibility of it happening

it may well be that democracy is too heavy-weight
but the only real way to prevent these kind of "hatfield & mccoy towns" is to bring groups of people together into diplomatic relationships where they can learn to respect other groups of people and agree on widespread strategies to filter out reactionaries and mitigate their damage
otherwise the reactionaries set up a "hatfield town" that sits there until the day one of them decides to create an empire and try to conquer the anarchists and the other "hatfield towns". which is closer to happening than you think when there have already been instances of "hatfield towns" burning down black towns just because they can



an individual right to be happy is not bad in and of itself. when it is bad, it is only bad in relation to other things
but things are almost always related to something, leaving consequences to your actions or even consequences to your inaction while something required action






"do not feed the alligators"   [*a]
there is something to be said about the conflict between government programs and communalism
if "stalinism" and the many-armed national party are bad while active cities with direct democracy are good,
then what grounding do you have to be for federal government programs, shouldn't cities be constructing them, and aren't federal government programs getting in the way of the actualization of cities?
i think there's a bizarre argument to be had for "not feeding the alligators" and making them form soviets if you believe in communalism. how else are the people going to keep power
