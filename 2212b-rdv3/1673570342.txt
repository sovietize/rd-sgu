the development of civilization
and its relation to postcolonial theories



marx describes the development of the european town - in a sense, how it was invented

european towns were largely based on guilds and their ability to lock down a particular market which would then be traded with the surrounding area
eventually this gave rise to large cities and capitalists
the process basically started at individual workshops and scaled up

eventually city markets had to connect together into national economies


tariffs for defending GDP as national Private Property



imperialist capitalism and the continued colony cycle to enrich businesses



we cannot use businesses as a means of decolonization
they are literally the mechanism which created and sustained colonialism,
by leading up to the idea that any conquest a country could pay for could be added to its Private Property with which it would become more prosperous


there is no real point where capitalism stops and racist empire begins, it is all just one continuum of capitalism which starts at shops and becomes cities and nations and empires and colonialism and then cities and businesses and labor aristocracy and empire again

that is to say, we've spiralled up the spiral dialectic into a new system with new feedback loops in it that didn't exist before, and if we continue to act like we're in the older stages and not in a new situation we might not be able to get out of the new situation because of the feedback loops continuously recreating the whole thing




the "split between town and country" is anything but easy to solve because it is inherently intertwined with the oppressive aspects of towns full of prototype small businesses in the specific way europeans decided to invent them

nothing in here is about medieval europeans themselves and everything is about the method they chose to do things in the particular historical situation they were in.
