## Market of Relationships, human worth, and advocacy **

in the United States, you can be all kinds of class-conscious and informed but if you want to convince anyone of anything at all you face a thorny problem with the society itself:
each person exists almost as a kind of Product or Shop. the abstract notion of markets is almost the founding metaphor of society itself on which every other concept rests.
- I think I'm saying that if you wanted to think in "master signifiers", the United States does not start with the Phallus (i.e. sexual differences and their transformation into our concepts of "becoming Mom" and "becoming Dad"), it starts with the Market of Relationships.



personally I have trouble shaking the feeling that I might not be "valuable enough" to a movement and movements can turn me away or "fire" me just because I'm bad at things
I write some hypothesis or thought like this outline and I get scared people will think it's really stupid and I don't know anything

this is psychological damage from capitalism
after years of not being able to get into jobs or get into social circles or climb up bourgeois newsfeed platforms or really be part of society, .




we are constantly sold the illusion that you simply begin with Life as a primary thing and then you go to a Job second, and perhaps the Job gets in the way of Life
but really that's almost a kind of "fake socialist attitude" used to make us think our society has grown past Mere Capitalism into something better when it hasn't
in reality everything is built upon Jobs including Life.
your entire notion of whether you deserve Life will be formed around how good your Job is and whether you've managed to secure one at all, and other people will never do anything to challenge this dynamic if they don't understand the concept of abolishing capitalism.
- this is why I think "merely organising people for better working conditions" isn't more effective than it is. you don't necessarily have a foundation for getting people to not give up and continuously stick up for themselves if you allow them to accept the default belief that deserving a Job is the foundation for their existence and they don't really have the power to replace that with a better philosophical foundation "any time soon"





the Relationship Market creates problems for getting people into organisations because they may feel like they don't have enough to contribute and the organisation is just going to stagnate and accomplish nothing if everyone in it were as 'useless' as them
- in this way people can actually have hidden wisdom: "wait, but what are we actually trying to do here? can we successfully do it or do we need to re-evaluate our strategies?"
- this is one reason I think that organisations neeed to shift from /saying/ some list of talking points to /asking/ people what they actually want in order to become a member


[honestly the section on indentured servitude contracts covers this idea much better]





### advocacy **

soviets as metaphor

the United States needs to rebuild the whole concept of advocacy

we can hardly successfully advocate for anything to anyone
so how do we get the strength to collectively bargain for any shared set of rights



> all the local people around me are hateable because they think covid is a lie and the vaccine is dangerous/evil (conservatives) OR covid went away (everybody else)
> we do not even have the small chunk of actual communists quite unified around the idea covid is dangerous and present and we need zero covid
> we live in just these strung-out small nests of people so i see the same hateable people a lot
> and i sometimes question for just a second if it's my responsibility to educate them because otherwise I just don't know how any of us will make it out of this in one piece.



social media market
> sometimes it's not even necessary to deliberately create incentives. sometimes the natural preference of viewers for one kind of content over another will create competition
pressure to do specific things to fit in
meaning supplied by market

preferring the social to real action
what do you do when you have a society that's purely social

centuries ago people had few routes to criticise class society other than religion
so people would construct arguments like: if you become virtualised and you decide to live your life only for yourself and accumulating material wealth that's bad because God or something. it may seem like there are no consequences if you don't care about anyone else and then you die and nothing matters, but you'll be judged in the afterlife!
it's great to be unchained from having to tie it to a religion but what do we even tie it to
it seems like death is just an infinite loophole for virtualisation, where you can't really argue there are truly consequences of being virtualised for the individual, and if they're virtualised they may not understand harms to other people.


> all society is shaped by the fact we have to be accepted by others / "be useful" to be part of society

this is ultimately not a terrible idea because
we can redirect this into the idea that every human being is /inherently/ some minimum amount of useful and you can't take that away.
and from there that it's on everyone to direct "surplus people" to some way they can contribute to society, rather than it being on the individual to prove they are useful and deserve to live or be part of society









## "wage slavery" is an outdated metaphor

## "kill me now" **

now I've been through the racism and Reconstruction angle of Markets... well here's the white LGBT angle

I'm autistic, transgender, Materialist and science-minded, and interested in creating and inventing things.
I don't get to be /any/ of these things to others without harsh judgement on at least one of them. so a lot of the time I would just withdraw from society to feel less stressed.

this has had strange effects on the way I think about identity and social rights.
I was so socially isolated from everyone that I worried mostly about whether I'd be able to get a Job or an Income and survive, and not so much about whether I would get to be "authentically" autistic or transgender because I just didn't get a lot of opportunity to talk to people or bond with them very much.
I went through a period where I was trying to be friends with Liberals who were all about LGBT+ rights and things but I couldn't quite wrap my head around in what sense anyone had them right now or in the future if most of the people I had to interact with in my life were reactionary and I couldn't budge them, or what grounding we were basing these rights on.
- if I don't deserve to eat or have a house to live in unless I obey some arbitrary parameters of some capitalist, how can I justify trans rights? it seems like the capitalist can always say no because they get to decide whether I deserve Life.
  - same with family members and any local trying to help you survive, however nice they seem.
- gender is also different from race because for one you can't necessarily decide I'm trans, or autistic, by looking at me. there's not a specific geographical area that "autistic" comes from that everybody has heard of, nor do people know visible autism traits as its "customs". so it's easier to act like both of them are entirely fake and unheard-of
  - and then I get woman'd and reactionary'd and given those expectations, which are more intolerable than just correctly being derided as a Godless Trans Commie
  - people really will just virtualise entire wrong mental models of who you are /and/ what you believe and regurgitate back the wrong beliefs at you whenever you try to explain the actual things and it sometimes makes me afraid the United States will never be able to understand the concept of material reality



I kept coming back to a recurring question whenever I was having a bad depression day.
"I might never be of any use to the Capitalist Economy as long as we have capitalism, would it be better to just kill me?"


'kill me. just kill me!'




'i will never be useful in capitalism, should i just be killed?'
'what if i'm equally not useful in a workers's state, should i just be killed?'
i confess that sometimes i just have a depression meltdown about this
i feel as if i'm never going to be useful to anyone enough to be worth keeping alive and my days are numbered; i can fight for Marxism and the era of socialism but maybe only for me to die young either way, either because i don't fit in or, without any malice, neither system was capable of sustaining enough people to sustain my life

i have to consciously think about the fact that there are people who don't "want to kill me" in the sense that they want to fight for Marxism to support my life, not so i can still be thrown out for not being good enough
this makes me softer on Trotskyism than I maybe should be because I at least know they don't "want to kill me" in this sense. I start to wonder if, as long as they're 'real communists' and not specifically somebody who will leave and become a conservative, we need people obsessed with government oppression to prevent the government from being able to decide to kill a bunch of people as traitors or generally decide who gets to live and be part of the society? so i try to think in terms of integrating them if at all possible because i don't want to force them or me to be part of a society that decides who is an acceptable human being and gets to live or gets to go without some kind of unnecessary punishment like when Cuba put the gays in a gay prison or Xi was put in prison for reasons I don't know before he returned and got into an important position, or something







## non-corporations


## uneven development into the era of communism **

the phenomenon of industries going from regular for-profit corporations with employees, to platforms with unpaid "creators", to finally, very slowly, community-run platforms was /so/ strange I had to question if everything we knew was wrong.
- at the time I first considered this, I was still very new to Marxism. I really ended up going deeper into Marxism and catching up on its history /because of/ my troubles with explaining what was going on with "platforms".
- so, the way I thought of it at the time was close to "I'm not sure Menshevism will do it, do we really just need to entirely reinvent Jobs?". but now I see that even if I'd started at a perfect understanding of Marxism-Leninism, Platforms would even have challenged the boundaries of that.

Platforms are still quite an enigma to me with a lot of unsolved questions.

- starting at the big picture with some pre-Marxist ideas,
  - we have nobility with certain territories, we have monarchs that conquer them and create single nations or empires, we have the feudal manor system where some local noble puts a bunch of peasants on a manor
  - then at a certain point the democratic republic is created, and miscellaneous people of a nation replace the king with a republic governed by some more elaborate structure or political party
    - the prototypical example is the French revolution, the peasants and bourgeoisie alike cannot stand the manor system or the king so they destroy both and attempt to create a new thing
  - then capitalism is created. capitalists found corporations which serve as the basis of industries, or colonies which will be conquered on a new continent. people work in the industries doing capitalist production as a part of life, or a few attempt to found their own corporations, and groups of corporations exert control over "democratic" republics and what policies they will have
    - but capitalism is inherently connected to war and conquest as a matter of expanding industries and larger business empires as widely as possible. it does not simply found industries /but also entire colony countries/
    - some colony countries successfully break free from capitalists and restart the same cycle, maybe taking their own colonies, while others remain stuck as Property. in this way capitalism is a bit of a "coloniser creating machine" where countries force other countries into the image of a weird offspring of themself... for profit
    - there is little distinction between the colony cycle and fascism besides "one is a bit meaner"
  - then, really starting around 1800, Marxism starts to emerge. people do not like capitalists and corporations and their power over democractic republics, so they overthrow the "dictatorship of the bourgeoisie" and the workers' state is created.
    - some of these movements even attempt to overthrow the colony cycle, but usually don't succeed. arguably North Korea and Vietnam successfully broke this cycle, however well they did after that
  - within workers' states a few things are tried such as local co-op structures, government ministries, soviets, attempts to regulate corporations, there are a bunch of things going on
  - a noble founds a structure: a province or manor. a king founds a structure: a nation, which becomes a republic. an emperor founds a structure: an empire, which becomes a federal republic. a capitalist founds a structure: a corporation, which becomes /maybe/ a state-owned enterprise subject to soviets.
    - notably I am not really sure if a colony freed from the colony cycle becomes anything in particular.
- I have no idea where Platforms fit in this history.
  - you don't really found a pay service like a tv channel that then itself directly turns into a corporate Platform like YouTube. they just kind of pop up as Platforms.
  - one thing that does typically happen to them is they get bought and are part of huge monopolies like Google or Verizon, because that's the only way they can stay open.
    - Amazon started with simple retail and then added an ebay-like Platform to what it already had
    - so they're like, always a 'late in a business's life cycle' kind of thing? only a Gigantic business really gets to have them
  - I think Platforms may be some kind of evolution of the general idea of retail; with retail a ton of other corporations make products for you, but if you're really greedy for the most products you want marketable products from every individual
    - in this sense Platforms could be thought of as 'so capitalist they exploded capitalism'. they are trying to create a system where Every individual puts products onto the market for the retailer to profit off and Every individual buys the products benefiting the retailer
    - but because that's not literally possible, advertisers have to buy the products. you have a cluster of big bourgeoisie all shuffling money between each other so the non-platforms can buy more 'user generated content' from the Platform
    - in retail it's kind of like you've got a three-tier relationship. the hyper-capitalist employs the capitalists employ the workers.


-






it may be worth considering that part of the reason we haven't shaken capitalism is we have very few people capable of "building socialism" and operating that new transitional system.
this is not something to be said in an accusing way pointing fingers at people, but simply a problem that may need to be remedied before we get robust organisations that won't just put up with capitalism.







## copyright and "publishers" / "free as in Marxism" **

who came the closest to being "a communist writer who understood socialism with American characteristics"? 
Richard Stallman!
he's not a communist, but he came much closer to an insight than people like Trotsky because he was actually able to take a moment to envision a United States entirely beyond private property with a new notion of freedom.

in "the Free Software movement" there is this whole discussion on the idea of libre vs gratis
GNU project pages explain at length how the software is free as in liberated, no it's not gratis
and it's always written as if people have a really hard time understanding the idea

a communist would understand this freedom immediately
'ah, right, the freedom from capitalist ownership of your tools of production.
the software isn't necessarily gratis because we need to reproduce the workers, but it's nobody's individual investment they gamble on the value of as a career and restrict people from to keep the investment to an individual or small group'



copyright may as well be called Bourgeoisright.

copyrights support / are highly compatible with the Liberal distortion that labour is owned by the individual as *productive property* which is the individual's investment, and ultimately everybody should live off individual investments.
the notion that labour "is" productive property is to say no proletarians exist, only a progression of lumpenbourgeoisie, microbourgeoisie, petty bourgeoisie, big bourgeoisie. which really is how a lot of Americans see the world.


"publishing" is an outdated and bourgeois concept — currently. it doesn't exactly have to be.



Authors' Guild - not a workers' organisation, a bourgeois organisation
many attempts to "organise workers" are confused by not knowing the difference between living off private property (bourgeoisie) and living off wages (proletariat)
many "workers" actually live off private property, whether it is directly held by them (like a stock or investment with their name on it), or the corporation has just made them so dependent on the corporation that their standard of living is most directly affected by changes in the corporation's private property versus literally anything else.
this is very important to understand because if microbourgeois "workers" fully believe things like that an author's wages can /only/ be obtained through private property, they will defend capitalism and individual corporations or petty bourgeoisie. they will make colossal errors like pointing at a particular petty bourgeois like J.K. Rowling and saying that because she is a "worker" (living off a huge heap of capital) she can dictate every social opinion such as whether people can be fired for transphobia.
this is literally the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie — Rowling is the bourgeoisie, but here gets to tell every actual worker that may exist what's acceptable if you want to be in the communist movement. you can see how this movement would /very/ easily undo itself before long as the bourgeoisie repeatedly objected to real change.



china banning individual mapping so government agencies can do it
fundamental misunderstanding of property
copyrights are completely invented property used to fabricate power relations
a workers' state should allow people to create a shared project as a matter of not literally owning individuals' activities and of encouraging them to be more productive voluntarily
in the time of the Bolsheviks they searched hard for people who simply felt like putting in more effort.
it is a grave mistake to overlook community-run efforts that are basically building the future eras of the economy for you and taking away a lot of the uncertainty about what is going to exist after corporations and what the workers' state should be trying to encourage

- of course, I do need to make clear: this isn't a Trotskyist argument that is trying to point out that this one error regarding the mapping agency 'clearly' breaks open "state capitalism". I just listened to this thing where Socialist Appeal was trying to tell all about the kulaks and were blaming Stalin's government for improperly encouraging more capitalists and private property, so yeah







## corporate control over consumer products **



> maybe we need to concentrate less on building new open hardware / ground-up software,
> and more on simply "forcing the corporations to undo the restrictions on hardware" in some sense
>
> maybe this is an economic relations problem where the real problem is we let corporations hold power over us
> and we really need to say, no, you Cannot hold power over what users do, that's capitalism stealing a toothbrush, that's improper
>
> it feels like we always end up fighting with "who is running our computer" even if it's merely a FOSS foundation or BDFL we don't like



if people are exhausted because their energy is used up at /their/ corporation, the only solution is for another corporation to do the life activities they're too exhausted to do, and thus for the Bourgeoisie to win more of material life.





## could users revolt? **

if we conceptualise corporate control over products as a problem of consumers not advocating for themselves,
we can imagine an almost soviet-style movement where users of things decide to assert power against whoever runs or develops them. /whoever/ develops them.

this may seem scary at first to somebody who develops something entirely independently and unpaid
but ultimately, it would be an instance of a terribly fractured society stitching itself back together.

in the Free Software movement, a very strange belief goes around that there can be a notion of "his project", "her project", "their project" — if the leader of some project makes a decision you don't like, "well it's their project!".
if a corporation pulled this we would call it bourgeois thinking and call out the corporation's leadership for making decisions its workers or customers might not agree with, in that situation likely for its own gain.
however we find it hard to fully let go of the idea of being microbourgeois where whatever you contribute to society is still owned by you and used to exert power over others to advance your own status and/or net worth.

it may be that if we want to build a stable society we must accept the idea that all Projects are created on behalf of the rest of society, and everyone who interacts with them a certain amount must be allowed to be part of the process of shaping them.

- I first began developing this idea in the period I was actively using mastodon, and saw a whole lot of people getting upset about the way FOSS projects were going or what wasn't finished although they had no ability to code or time to learn it.
  - many people were too busy with day jobs to learn to code. I'm not sure whether they qualified as proletarians, but taking things charitably, maybe they were and this was a moment where we can see that worker democracy is not enough for working people because they will always be affected by /other/ workplaces or organisations making bad decisions, even if democratic, even if nonprofit.
  - the idea of User Democracy was quite foreign and novel to me at the time since I had not fully reached Marxism-Leninism yet or learned what a soviet or planning system was.
    - but after seeing the happenings I saw, it was hard to reject the facts. I just quickly accepted that not everybody would have the skill to Produce whatever thing somebody produces at a job and unless or until we got closer to closing that gap we would need some kind of User Democracy that even I would be subject to.
- I also saw the pattern repeat other places such as YouTube.
  - a whole lot of youtube videos were just people complaining about some consumer product and how the corporation should have made it better. though the reviewer typically had no concept of just ending Bourgeois Production — they could not imagine a world where somebody from the community could just be allowed to go to the company and innovate, .

- for a little while I tried to rationalise User Democracy with a model where a new class of Consumers was emerging inside platforms that would have to struggle against overly skilled proletarians and petty bourgeoisie to equalise control over daily life. I don't necessarily hold to this any more.
  - for one, I did not quite understand what classes were at the time I was making this model, and now I have a better understanding.
  - arguably this old model almost lines up with what I said about the lumpens, but if so the model would stop being true once they were elevated into the proletariat.


- dictatorship of /Pokémon/
- at this point we have a dictatorship of the bourgeoisie over our entire lifestyle
  - conservatives do really gross things like rationalise unsatisfactory things about "Women's" clothing as "just the style now" — that is, the market spoke (although it maybe didn't), the bourgeoisie decided everyone would experience this product a certain way with a certain idea of gender, and now everybody has to accept what the bourgeoisie gave them because Free Market or something.
  - family members would police what I was allowed to buy on the so-called Free Market and I reached a point where I just did not want to buy any new clothes or anything until I could live in my own housing unit and never talk to them. which still hasn't happened, because good job capitalism on making houses available
  - and then.... when they'd see I was reusing or repairing old things, they'd get worried and spontaneously try to buy me new things. it became clear that United States culture is all about always having things that /look/ shiny and expensive but it's okay to throw them away after a month or a year as long as you /look/ richer than a black person from a poor neighbourhood. products are /only/ window dressing.
  - the most outrageous part is that people simultaneously believe in Bourgeois-Productive Dictatorship and 
  - think for a moment about how even christian bibles are actually a physical product and somebody is actually making money if a certain segment of people engage in activities that involve more people seeing or obtaining a bible, as long as it results in any new bibles being printed or sold

- sometimes it seems to me like the people of the United States actually interact with consumer products more than workplaces or working hours, and thus maybe the only way to get a large number of people to consistently resist capitalism is to ally everybody against bourgeois products and demand proletarian products which don't allow capitalists and relatives to force certain social practices into people's lives for the benefit of the bourgeoisie.

- it's hell trying to explain that you can't merely solve a social problem involving the interactions between people /for one person/. if you conceptualise all of society as the problems facing an individual, a bunch of mean individuals who are individually mean to other individuals can all suddenly unite and create fascism and there's nothing you can do about it.


## monster empires **


## continuous production and "creatorism" **

in the era of capitalism everything had to be packaged into a discrete product and sold as-is
but in the internet age it is now possible for many products to be produced and published in partial increments over time
this is a good thing for consumers, because if the product is going a bad direction they can now speak up before a given version is fully finished.
although there are many problems with implementing Continuous Production right now, such as: if our whole economy is designed around selling Finished Products on a Market or attracting bourgeois Investors to fund them, how can we fund it?

this concept must be integrated into proletarian democracy:
democracy applies /to/ workers and it is not just /for/ them. worker democracy must also include a dialectic with consumers so it does not become some kind of "dictatorship of co-ops over consumers".

creatorism - the successor to consumerism
everyone gets to be a 'creator' rather than "creator" being a bourgeois role only to be done by the people who own centres of Bourgeois Production


it's actually a little easier to conceptualise a solution to continuous production if there was a planning system, because then a particular amount of work could be requested and the person could "take a break" and do other work between requests rather than people having to begin work and then ask for compensation




## resistance through Production Cycle discipline


## dialectical cooperation and the YouTube Algorithm **

for a long time I racked my brain about the relationship of the YouTube Algorithm to Bolshevism.
because the YouTube Algorithm was a very weird thing. there were bad things about it but seemingly also very good and underappreciated things about it.

the first thing I noticed was that the YouTube Algorithm was /tunable/.
while I saw many people complain that it recommended them things they didn't want (repeatedly), and this problem is definitely real,
I noticed that with a lot of persistence one can periodically click the "don't recommend" options on a bunch of channels and videos and/or delete some items from an account's Watch History, and effectively /manually feed the Algorithm a curated set of input/ that will steer recommendations in a different direction.
if you know how to do this, the YouTube Algorithm becomes much closer to tolerable. you can decide what kinds of things you want to watch at the moment, draw a line against all other things, and get mostly what you want, or at least "almost" what you want.
- you can visit their.tube for a clear demonstration that this works — researchers fed the Algorithm particular kinds of videos consistently on each account and demonstrated that they could purposefully tune it for environmentalism, right-wing conspiracy theories, and various other things.
- naturally the most fun thing is to tune it for Marxism and get all the audiobooks and history lessons. or for very advanced videogame glitches and get all the "parallel universe guides", if that's your thing

however, growing up in isolation from people and jobs and anyone who would listen to leftism, I ended up informally studying the workings of YouTube /a whole lot/.




I think too much about events like when Stalin's government attempting to create Jewish republics to end a problem of anti-semitic violence but ethnic discrimination did not really stop
I think you cannot really end unnecessary competition or violence /by/ segregating people into separate environments, because in each case people will always discover they're part of the same world and affect each other.

applying this concept to ideologies and right-wing "echo chambers",
the YouTube Algorithm is the kind of structure that is maybe a third of the way to solving this problem — but no more.
on YouTube, everybody is simply encouraged to Post, and Post whatever. you can post a craft tutorial, or a Marxist idea, or almost whatever you want to within certain boundaries.
but if a video comes up in your recommendations that is somehow objectionable, there's a whole lot less you can do to contribute to YouTube in order to "make bad ideas go away".
- you can Dislike the video
- you can leave a comment about why it's wrong that maybe nobody will see, while many people still get recommended the wrong video
- you can Report the video, which may result in nothing
- you can make a criticism video, which may actually be the most effective counter because only another video can compete with the wrong video in the Algorithm
  - however, now you risk amplifying the wrong message through further responses, or simply viewers that have already made up their mind getting more upset and telling others about how "wrong" your criticism is or how it's connected to evil conspiracies

there is a flaw in the idea that speech "remedies speech", which is that a simple back-and-forth is very badly designed to be an objective tool or a tool for making progress.
- if two groups of people are simply going to have an argument with no prior shared goal or third party they have to satisfy with an acceptable solution, the argument can't have any final answer other than "who was the loudest", so everyone in the back-and-forth is incentivised to be as loud as possible in order to Win.
  - the United States always starts with presuppositions like "transgender people and transphobes will get along, and we will have a democratic republic by all of them collectively choosing the best solution".
  - however, there is no universal code of ethics in this situation. both groups have entirely different codes of ethics and sets of facts so it is impossible to say "which one is correct" and simultaneously maintain the goal that they both have to cooperate with each other to reach a solution.
    - you must either abandon the goal that everybody cooperates or abandon the goal of an objectively correct solution in favour of making it entirely about what creates a cooperative dialogue.
    - out of the two, only abandoning cooperation makes any sense, because insisting on red-brown cooperation often leads to ideas that are totally detached from reality having equal ground to Materialist ideas. and the unravelling of human rights because it's easier to get everyone to "Agree" on oppressive rules than sensible ones.
  -
- worse, many people in the United States come to believe that Winning back-and-forth arguments /is/ an acceptable arbiter of truth so you simply have to tell everybody to be loud and abandon looking for other ways.



opportunism is undialectical
because you don't even get cooperation much less progress


only dialectical cooperation breaks competition

Productisation - society may need to go through a temporary period of forcing a few things that rely on government funding into Production Cycles, mainly things like academic theorists
this could cause a lot of potential problems so I am not enthusiastic about this idea being correct
but it could be that the surest way we get society to tame the anarchy of production is to force more people to live off their labour and live off selling Production Cycles such that we all understand what this feels like and will all want to switch to a planned economy where living a proletarian life through Production Cycles is less uncertain and exhausting

## creating a good world for crows **

seeing things at a worldwide scale is a core idea for me
I don't think I could ever go back to any ideology that's not international or doesn't consider the environment outside human societies... the whole environment

I think of it day-to-day like, there are so many other organisms on earth
corvids in particular are very intelligent and seem the closest to developing self-awareness of any bird
what's it like to be born a crow and go through your whole life not really having any idea what humans are talking about or doing?
the crow, raven, or magpie has a certain small amount of "culture" and "social practices", it is a social animal that lives in a particular family or group and develops particular habits over its life largely based on its surroundings   [*cc]

imagine human history from the point of view of a crow population.


humans proceeded to destroy a lot of the environment in the process of "developing" each country
and then they pointlessly fought each other

corvids in particular had some ability to adapt to existing in human cities, but in general,
every life form on earth was subject to being destroyed because humans could not cooperate or contain themselves

the crows did nothing to deserve this


recycling was supposed to be one way individuals could pitch in to help contain the environmental effects of capitalism.
but it costs money to run a recycling plant, so recycling plants find it hard to run unless they sell the recycled materials back to corporations.
- you'll frequently see a recycling plant stop taking glass or stop taking tin cans, etc., but meanwhile a soda corporation starts an independent program to take back aluminum cans, basically a privately-owned recycling program to send materials to a particular corporation that happens to be offered at no cost.
  - a number of products are available in stores that are "made from recycled materials", but guess who had the resources to make them. corporations.
  - do you keep a lot of recyclables? want to actually get them recycled? good luck starting a business and selling products to people to attempt to scrape together enough money to stay open, because you won't be able to convince Liberal governments to do it and existing businesses may not even pay you for the materials.
- in effect corporations are always in charge of whether we have recycling or everyone throws things away, because they are in charge of /everything/ we do with materials on a large scale.
  - this is simply how Bourgeois Production works: customer is not in charge of product, corporation is in charge of product. want to recycle a product? oh I don't want to do that production, that's too expensive.
- this is another example of anarchism's 'industry problem' because in order for anarchists to implement functional recycling programs, they have to create entire anticapitalist businesses and industries that will use the materials to ensure none of them will be thrown away or be considered 'too costly to use' without recreating capitalism.


you could make a similar argument with any human population outside a given country and the right of any of these outside people to live.
but honestly I think using animals is more effective because then it's impossible to invoke some uniquely human concept of why you can dismiss another population of humans as acceptable collateral damage.
the crows should be an objective wake-up call about the fact that things outside our particular civilisation will always be affected by our decisions inside the civilisation and we cannot get out of this with excuses like "I couldn't build an alternative to capitalists tomorrow, so I don't know how to stand up to mismanaged industries and habitat destruction".

the more I learn about the history of the United States and the history of communist revolutions the more I start to wonder if the United States should be analysed more like a feudal monarchy than a modern republic.
I see a bunch of commonalities with the Russian Empire and various other kingdoms /before there was even a bourgeois revolution/. it's almost as if we made a bad fake republic that's not even really a republic.

- Reconstruction.
  -
- the United States kind of just hates republics. paradoxically.
  - a republic is when you end a country being owned by a royal family and give the country collectively to the people, but you have to create new structures to run this collective government
  - we really hate the idea of all the people collectively owning the United States
    - the most obvious form is when white supremacists get upset about black people or mexican immigrants getting to "have" the United States as equally as them, and try to assert the United States is built on a particular concept of nationalism that only they can be in charge of
    - you also see this with ideologies, where right-wingers don't want centre-Liberals to be equal citizens of the United States and get to corrupt it with progressive values
  - we hate "government" but don't realise that equals hating democracy
    - 
  - we hate "politics", even progressives, but don't realise that equals letting go of democracy
    - nobody really wants to seriously talk about what the republic is doing including progressives
    - a naïve idea goes around that "politics shouldn't be touching people's lives" although if that were truly the case they wouldn't need to vote and there wouldn't be democracy
    - progressives want to simply vote, check out, and talk about videogames. they want one vote to magically remove all bigotry and voter suppression and attempts to destroy the republic
    -
- people get really upset by the Bolsheviks smashing theocracy because they literally can't tell the difference between "a church existing" and "a large established church that creates theocracy"
  - you constantly see people erase the fact that /religion was brought back/ in the USSR after the initial attack on the Orthodox Church and people were allowed to have religion again.
    - people will really talk like no religion was allowed at all ("I can't believe the Soviet people couldn't have bibles!"), and I think that reveals something about what rights they think Religions should "normally" or "ideally" have
- many other countries similar to the United States /still have a king/, even if ceremonial. the UK, Canada, and Australia have the british crown, Japan has an emperor.
  - this should wake us up to the fact that a democratic republic is a matter of building /government structures/ such as parliament more than abolishing monarchs.
  - Liberal democracy was established in the UK by defeating the 1600s Tories and giving power to parliament rather than actually budging monarchy.
- a lot of people note that how Marx talked about Germany and the Bolsheviks talked about the Russian Empire "sounds a lot like US capitalism". but these writers saw the United States very differently from the way we do.
  - Marx's text on the question of Jewish political emancipation really exposes this. he keeps talking about how germany is not a republic and "doesn't really have citizens yet" and is very incomplete while the United States must be so much better in comparison, I mean for starters it's already a republic  [*jm]
  - it was unclear to me why Lenin and Trotsky talked about the United States the way they did until I read that Marx text. and then it hit me.... what had happened was they all /bought the United States' bullshit/ and truly believed it was much better than their countries while US communists know better than that

- a lot of conservatives in the United States conflate the ability to do something in complete privacy basically separated from society with a real social right to do something while others are aware you're doing it
  - Libertarians will get really obsessed with "privacy" and things encroaching onto "privacy" and leaking any information about them, but what this really refers to is an idea that concealing things from the rest of society IS the way we get the freedom to do them.
  - this leads to the disgusting notion that LGBT people have freedom /when/ nobody knows LGBT people exist and they hide it from the rest of society, so we don't need to codify or protect LGBT rights
  - then there's a double standard where conservatives want the right to spew right-wing ideas in public and don't want to be pushed to only believing them in public, although this /should/ be consistent with their concept of social rights
  - this is a bit of an unsolved problem in existing workers' states: in several cases people have been given "freedom" by exempting that thing from the realm of communist party discussion, accidentally leading to a society where regular individuals oppress that thing and it isn't protected
    - this has given a lot of Liberals a false notion that communist thought is inherently "anti-LGBT" and a few other things, while that wasn't actually intentional as much as a prejudice in society at large that carried over from before the revolution and was improperly stuffed into the private realm instead of being addressed as a question that may affect the health of the republic and the agreement to be part of a single society

- another dumb but pervasive Libertarian idea: that corporations are a tool of /the Deep State/
  - people complain that they don't have "free speech" at corporations, which sounds benign enough
    - you'd almost think maybe they want an economic republic with a bill of rights and they'd join a labour movement to overthrow capitalism.
  - but what they really mean is that they hate all governments of any kind, and corporations imposing restrictions on them is Too Much Government, so inevitably The Government will scoop up the corporation and use it for control /if/ we don't resist every human being putting restrictions on us anywhere ever
    - this is a flat-out rejection of the entire idea of laws or republics. literally you cannot have laws if nobody is allowed to put restrictions on you in any case
  - they really believe this is how China works — that capitalism always appears as a means of control /therefore/ it is used by the Chinese government. Mao created "New Democracy" to control you with capitalism, not to develop sections of the economy.
  - I think we have basically ended up with such "extreme" far-righters that they've gone beyond anarcho-capitalism. capitalism is too much government, /anarchism/ would be too much government.
    - they want complete freedom from other individuals and material reality itself.
    - in this way, it's like we really have found a way the "libertarian" side of the Libertarian political compass chart can be toxic /in and of itself/.
  - with a problem like this we really can't rebuild the United States through anarchism. we first have to in some way deprogram the population that having to be part of society and cooperate with others is not tyranny, or else all appeals to freedom or 'hierarchy' can destroy society
    - an anarchist revolution would basically result in open civil war where far-righters clump into pockets and anarchists clump into pockets and then they war with each other for land and resources.
    - it ends when every conservative is dead, or every anarchist is dead and conservatives have dismantled corporations and governments and created some undefined new thing. non-aggression pacts?
    - non-aggression pacts would eventually upset them because eventually there'd be neo-feudalism and the neo-aristocrats that monopolised large areas would impose restrictions on everybody who walked through that and they'd just get upset all over again.
      - revolutionary Libertarianism is ironically weirdly egalitarian in the end? they claim private property is a right but get super upset whenever it inevitably turns into Government to the point they ultimately have to be for people having equal amounts of property or some kind of 'commoning' system to prevent Government.
    - I guess we'd be looking at Aggression Pacts where if anyone uses property to impose Government you can fight them and take the oppressive portion of their property away. and this is supposed to eventually give way to an era where nobody takes the risk of imposing Government and everyone caves to what everyone else wants
  - Bolshevism is looking pretty good now, isn't it? in comparison to revolutionary Libertarianism, the ratio of how many people you're supposed to cooperate with versus fight or kill in the transitional period is a lot better
-



thought 11/25:
the US has already entered a class struggle,
but what it specifically looks like is miscellaneous citizens scrambling and squabbling over control of corporations /regardless of class/ so that the corporate structures that run our society will create "good policies" regarding social issues. outsider capitalists are rushing to buy corporations like Twitter to swing them rightward, while "user-workers" are flailing around trying to insist that the corporations do the right thing or somebody stop the Bad Capitalists although the general working class doesn't truly have much control over this struggle right now when they generally accept that capitalists "have to" run things and they might have to put up their own capitalist to buy Twitter to successfully win this
it'd be like...... soviet Liberalism. to prevent Liberalism from collapsing we have to invent soviet Liberalism where voters always get to choose between capitalists but they're sadly still capitalists

# Everyday Democracy **












## uneven development into the era of communism **

Free Software is one of the strangest things for anyone to invent inside a capitalist society.
it's as if software development skipped to socialism and abolished private property, but nothing else did.

likewise the existence of completely community-run ad-free platforms is just as weird.
OpenStreetMap, Wikipedia, archive.org, linux package repositories, the fediverse, 
here it's almost like people got /so/ tired of capitalism they skipped all the way to communism.
though in neither case did people have any idea that's what they were doing.

like this, First World countries may actually be full of small "previews" into the eras of socialism and communism,
neither of which can stably expand over the whole country without the right kind of support

this exposes a deep unsolved question in both communist and anarchist thought:
what are our movements supposed to be doing if our country is developing unevenly?
one part of material life is capitalist Jobs, another exists without private property and by people voluntarily creating and running public services - but without any kind of proper support for its workers or keeping its services open long-term in any sense.
it's like we created a new way to build social institutions and products which requires neither taxes nor capitalist unit prices and fees, but we fundamentally cannot pay for them or give them any kind of long-term preservation

traditionally such "Socialist" movements have always defined themselves as "labour movements"
but is that what the task really is?
or do they need to address all three simultaneous phases?
breaking workers out of capitalism, removing capitalist control from daily life, proletarianising the "lumpenbourgeoisie" and "microbourgeoisie" so they don't reproduce corporations, removing unnecessary competition seen in places like The Youtube Algorithm that encourages people to become petty bourgeoisie, leading society away from the concept of "investments", creating organisations that don't close in a short time and can manage the new institutions, compensating people to create the new institutions so they don't give up and reproduce corporations, getting people from massive duplicated effort and waste to coordination so projects can be finished, generally replacing the concept of Jobs with something that doesn't require constantly producing and selling crappy Finished Products

at least half of this is already addressed in Marxist-Leninist writings, usually as things that happen 'after the revolution'
but the United States has done a strange thing of darting into the future on some tasks while trying as hard as possible to keep capitalism intact and make sure even social-democratic programs are literally replaced with somebody's private investments.
- we can have free abortions and vaccines *only* for employees at specific corporations, otherwise vaccines and abortions are both really evil. ditto with gay rights, you only get them as an employee at your really nice friendly corporation and not in the overall society
- every health service is private: the "government health insurance marketplace", health savings accounts, corporate healthcare benefits, the recent attempt to privatise Medicare







this implies an anarchist revolution involves flat-out building the societal structures of socialism which will be used instead of corporations and capitalist employment, and it cannot succeed if all it does is resist capitalism
however, now anarchism has to answer the question of "how do we pay for the revolution". if there will be no force in the revolution, it has to entice people to its cause with things such as a better society already forming. but if people can't participate in the "pockets of socialism/communism" and get compensated as capitalist Jobs are able to reproduce workers, then this particular concept of revolution never goes through




purely volunteer projects may be a preview of the era of communism
it is not yet stable over large areas
socialism is much more stable for the near future
thus the era of socialism should be constructed to stabilise isolated communism and allow it to eventually expand

trotsky - he only got this one "right" because it came from simple observations of Russia rather than an actual prediction.
he could have gotten it wrong if the pattern was going to change across the three eras rather than continue.
- look at how he watched the Soviet Union pick up republics and then told the United States it was definitely going to pick up Canada and Mexico "like iron filings", or saw the soviets form and said that was a good idea for everywhere. he sees a pattern and projects the same exact pattern across everything.





anarchy of production

anarchy of production is the default even without capitalism
so we must build Non- anarchy of production in order to have it, or we never will

> maybe we really need to be saying something like "a planning system doesn't build itself"

we don't need to search hard to remove /all/ competition of every kind from society,
since A) that's probably impossible and B) it may be that some kinds are not actually harmful
but we do need to look for the kinds of competition that represent an anarchy of production,
or factions fighting with each other to control a particular role in society as with non-Marxist ideologies fighting Marxism.


> that doesn't immediately attack the problem of proprietary hardware, but I feel sort of like the two things could merge into each other if we could just get people to _care_ and _want to build better things_




























# unsolved questions in "RD-ism"

## what do we do with conservatives?








## anxieties over proletarianisation

once we understand the United States as an attempt to turn everyone into bourgeoisie and all careers into investments/"property", where fewer people than usual are "genuine" proletarians, all the dumb alarmism about Marxism makes a /little/ more sense.

if people were truly proletarianised, many concepts they interact with in their daily life would be entirely different.
- no defining aspirations in terms of private property, as with microbourgeoisie building YouTube channels or petty bourgeoisie "turning a hobby into a corporation", or even left-wing theorists unknowingly aspiring to "outcompete" other theories like Marxism-Leninism
- no defining societal success in terms of one individual's private property or success
- individual survival plans such as "retirement" etc become less important or folded into social movements. currently people really have part of their attention eaten up by individual survival to where they forget collective survival is even an idea
- no covering up economic failures with civil rights movements; no trying to reassure LGBT+ the only reason they can be homeless or fired is transphobia 'but we're totally looking out for you on transphobia'
- in a sense there only /is/ one kind of proletarianisation, and it more resembles the Soviet Union than anything people in the United States usually tend to think of.

thus you can almost understand people going "aaaa! Communism is Pol Pot and if we become proletarians we're all going to die".   [*p]
the average worker's conception of "earning money" or "being productive" is incredibly bourgeois, and if you abolish the bourgeoisie, how would we earn what we need to live or produce anything???
thus you really have to persuade them how being petty-/microbourgeoisie is /not/ better for anyone and it's better to become proletarian even if it seems scary at first

I don't know what to tell them.
like, there are all the points in here, but what do you do with somebody who's virtualised the rest of society into their mental model of a Bourgeois Production cycle and thinks human rights are the single most important thing but whoever constructed our Industries and Jobs gets to decide who has them simply because there's "no alternative" to that state of things?
Rainbow Stalinism I guess. teach them that as long as there are LGBT rights and anti-racism there's no alternative to "state capitalism" because that's what provides individual success
that feels so dishonest though. they should have to get a better mental model where the people who run the economy don't determine everybody's rights


## justifying the human being **

I have a lot of trouble just personally with the tension between existing in a "hyper-bourgeois" society and trying to argue individuals deserve life

I feel better when I read about the Bolsheviks because for them the question was so simple. it was just, our society has fallen apart, do we all deserve to have a society to live in especially when the bourgeoisie still exist? of course, it's not like we deserve life less than the bourgeoisie.

but in the United States it's not as clear "how people deserve life"

- everybody's concept of how we obtain Life is so individual
  A) philosophically, you obtain Life by shouting and competing with other ideologies or people
  B) economically, you obtain Life by chance, you just kind of take what you can get

- so what do you tell people who are depressed and don't want to live, who don't feel assertive.
  - how do you get people to feel like they have the right to live when everyone exists in a society where Life is something we obtain so individually for such specific actions. it can feel like if you don't figure out the right set of steps to get Life you don't deserve it
  - we often obtain Life at the expense of someone else. so it can feel like advocating for yourself is implicitly risking making other people's lives worse, if only by giving them an impossible request and annoying them
  - this applies to people advocating for collective survival, for intersectionality, and for Marxism
  - do you have the right to speak to a movement or do we let movements kick anybody out for any reason

- if it's reasonable to say you don't have the right to believe Just Anything since it might sometimes be harmful, how can I justify being allowed to believe Marxism if people may think it's harmful.
  - (although if you try very hard to have a factual understanding of history the inherent harms are unknown.)
- how do I have the right to assert anything at anyone really, including about COVID, including /anything/, if they seem to not want to listen.
  - it's clear to me anything called "American society" has already shredded apart because you cannot even tell people how to Not Die. we are /that much/ not in the same boat with each other. you almost feel bad trying to help COVID deniers with anything in their lives because what if they don't want that either

- who has to prove themself to who? do we have to prove ourselves to movements to be accepted and convince others or do movements have to prove themselves to us? does a person have to prove themself to society or does society have to prove itself to us?
  - this is not as simple as it seems, because if we entirely believe society must prove itself to us then it was okay for Trotsky to cause trouble instead of cooperate




i don't know how to argue communists deserve life

we have the freedom to speak any opinion without being suppressed by the government and then get murdered by a fellow citizen who doesn't think you have the right to Life
