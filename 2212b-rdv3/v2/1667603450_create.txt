# into "creatorism" / breaking the Cycle


## continuous production and "creatorism" **

Continuous Production:
in the era of capitalism everything had to be packaged into a discrete product and sold as-is
but in the internet age it is now possible for many products to be produced and published in partial increments over time
this is a good thing for consumers, because if the product is going a bad direction they can now speak up before a given version is fully finished.
although there are many problems with implementing Continuous Production right now, such as: if our whole economy is designed around selling Finished Products on a Market or attracting bourgeois Investors to fund them, how can we fund it?

this concept must be integrated into proletarian democracy:
democracy applies /to/ workers and it is not just /for/ them. worker democracy must also include a dialectic with consumers so it does not become some kind of "dictatorship of co-ops over consumers".

creatorism - the successor to consumerism
everyone gets to be a 'creator' rather than "creator" being a bourgeois role only to be done by the people who own centres of Bourgeois Production

it's actually a little easier to conceptualise a solution to continuous production if there was a planning system, because then a particular amount of work could be requested and the person could "take a break" and do other work between requests rather than people having to begin work and then ask for compensation

## resistance through Production Cycle discipline

regarding the way that
1. "social media" newsfeeds seem to have turned social interaction into a process of Production where we competitively exchange Finished Products (much more so on long-form or monetised platforms like YouTube)
2. perversely we have /accepted/ this intrusion of Markets into daily life and the idea of understanding any "value" we "produce" for society as being literal Production for a Market
I see a conceivable way for this process to accidentally teach people how to resist capitalism and Bourgeois Production.
if capitalism usually benefits from us /not/ knowing what's going on and /silently/ intruding into our life, but it's now intruded so far that everyone interacts with its logic in unexpected places, will everyone accidentally begin learning to resist capitalism as they resist everyday annoyances they don't think are capitalism?
- this wouldn't guarantee an organised or energetic resistance or even everybody learning that these problems /were capitalism/.
- it would only guarantee that everybody would now technically have ended up with 'tools to resist capitalism' because capitalism had intruded so far everyone would be annoyed by it every day

while growing up I always thought that the logic of "social media" newsfeeds was separate from everything else that wasn't that, and we could simply refuse to use newsfeeds and not have to worry about it.
but in the past few years one news article really made me re-think the relationship between newsfeeds and the way for some people computer files are haphazardly scattered across "the cloud" or simply the computer with folders being a secondary idea.   [*cg]
> "Students have had these computers in my lab; they'll have a thousand files on their desktop completely unorganized"
> It could also have to do with ... Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, and YouTube ... all pulling content from a vast online sea
> Working with befuddled students has convinced Garland that the "laundry basket" may be a superior model. ... she uses her computer’s search function to find her schedules and documents when she’s lost them

so, students in the sciences don't know how to use folders because everything has become one haphazard chronological river of Stuff?
maybe this doesn't happen for the reasons you'd immediately think of.

I think this phenomenon of 'thinking in timelines' actually happens because our society is getting immensely obsessed with /production/.
- note that I didn't even say Bourgeois Production, just /production/ in general of any kind.
  - I think we are witnessing a weird process where society as a whole is pushing everyone to be more productive and constantly think about producing Finished Products to market to others, but it's not even connected directly to capitalism. people now just have a drive to /produce/ and /market/ informal Products even if they won't receive any money or paid job for this.
  - it's a bit like we've convinced people Production /is/ society or something, so fighting your way up a newsfeed by producing the most popular stuff is inherently "social".
    - this is the reason I can't stand using the phrase "social media" unironically. I feel like it entrenches this idea that individualistic competition /is/ socialising, and this does very bad things to society.
- now that everybody pushes everybody else toward constant Production at work and at home (and at school if applicable), everybody has a hard time organising thoughts by category.
  - think back to grade school, you probably had to organise things in folders for some particular project with a particular temporal beginning and due date, and once it was done you may not have had any idea where to archive it besides maybe "grade X", another time-based category fitting particular objectives into a particular temporal beginning and end.
  - now perhaps you've graduated college — or at least 12th grade and vocational training — and whenever you want to organise your computer backups or old projects, you always find that your most consistent organisation method is by year and month, or "old computer 1" "old computer 2". nothing else seems to be as reliable as temporal periods at separating things which you currently want from anything else.
  - maybe you do just enough programming you've decided to move over most of your backup strategy to git repos, where you simply track one particular project folder of files over time.
    - and even then you may find you run into a problem when you have to back up your whole home directory but some of it is git repos and some isn't and you still have to manually compare everything to delete old backups and not waste a bunch of disk space. (although comparing copies of the git repos is much simpler by design.) so you still end up with separate time periods
  - in any case, you probably find that years and months advance more reliably than your ability to plan out and finish or even organise conceptual categories of anything.
  - and you probably end up with /years/ serving as conceptual boundaries where you leave e.g. a bunch of work shelved inside "2019" and start some other work fresh within "2020"; you may find it takes effort to connect failed ideas across these two bodies of work.
    - to me it can sometimes feel like I have an unwritten time limit of a month or two to finish something such as a video, and if I don't finish it fast enough it simply dies. I will never finish it in that particular form, even though there was no particular thing that stopped me and said I had no more time.

- some microbloggers on mastodon (and maybe Twitter) have remarked that the only good way for them to record a chain of thoughts over time 'without losing them' is in microblog threads.
  - I think what this reflects is a growing need for /all thoughts and ideas/ to be Produced as a Finished Product on some particular timetable.
  - first of all, a single microblog entry is /short/ — you take a short amount of time and either it gets Finished or discarded.
  - second, a microblog thread has a particular temporal beginning, and when you make entries within a thread, you connect them to that particular temporal period.
    - said another way, a microblog thread is a chronological /history/ of a particular idea where events related to the first event are added to the history and represent a progression toward whatever will be considered the "final" latest event of that particular small period of history.
  - third, publication. I feel like this is not actually critical compared to the history aspect, but I think it's important to some people.
    - posting a microblog thread to the public can act as a filter for which ideas to focus on, based on whether they sounded good outside of your head, what kind of response they got if any, and other things.
    - as somewhat covered already, publication to a "social media" Market can make you think about what it is people actually /need/ and what you should make if you want to be useful and "popular"
  - for a while I thought the big breakthrough to make with threads was to realise they were a kind of dialectic.
    - I think this is still true. I think you can definitely /use/ a conceptual microblog-thread-like structure as a dialectic in order to purposefully finish an idea by developing it from its temporal beginning across its interactions with other things to its temporal end where it is deemed "as realised as it really needs to be".
  - but now I think the full breakthrough is to see threads as a conflict between the Dialectical and the Cyclical.
    - when we try to use threads to tame our executive function or organisation problems, it's us nearly-realising we are trapped in meaningless Cycles like newsfeeds and Bourgeois Production and trying to break out of them and learn dialectics but not fully knowing how to do it effectively enough to break any of the Cycles.

- it begins to seem like if we have "projects" and we'd like to finish them, the best way in the short term is to /embrace/ the intrusion of production cycles and simply attempt to finish each cycle.
  - this means: realising every project has a temporal beginning and end, grouping all related failed projects onto the same beginning, and trying to get that one particular cycle to whatever its end is.
    - this says nothing about whether intermediate failed projects should be published. if you feel like it, I think there's no problem with publishing them when the final version is ready to be published, or at whatever date you may decide it's appropriate to post them.
  - "/whatever/ its end" is important. if you want to get something done, /finish it/; don't worry about if it's good. don't worry about if you'll get paid.
    - you may end up getting so bitter about the fact society can't offer you any paid job anywhere that you only want to make communist propaganda any more. but hey, maybe that's the missing thing society needs.
  - this concept applies to both large projects, which may need to go through many iterations over years to get finished, and small projects like videos, which you should attempt to cut into small chunks that can be Finished and published efficiently. /just finish it/, even if it's not as substantial as you wanted.
- importantly, the final part of the cycle should be /publication/ or /public archival/.
  - archive.org is a great place for publicly archiving Finished Products which have no quality guarantee on them other than they're "finished" and were published on a certain date.
    - what I do is post my work-in-progress files to archive.org along with the Finished files in hopes it might help people learn to make videos, or some of the video frames might be appropriate for reuse
    - I also try to create transcripts of the videos using bopwiki, which can serve as a kind of "dialectical blogging system" where various ideas can be connected temporally or conceptually into a 'train of thought'. e.g. I can connect entries about various texts into a reading list, or texts to hypotheses or videos
  - some things may not be appropriate to post publicly for some reason, and if so, personally archiving the thing in some private way is fine. becoming able to Finish things is still important
  - publishing /for use/ by others is a way we can turn even the Cyclical creation of Finished Products into resistance. (eventually.)
    - you look at a lot of content, for example, on YouTube, and it can seem like it's just an endless cycle of the same stuff over and over again where nothing talking about especially news or politics really makes any new insights
    - but, if we encourage people to publish videos to a commons instead of just for a Market or for their individual "shop", and maybe more importantly to produce actually meaningful content that breaks some kind of new ground even in a small way, we can slowly open up a "dialectic" of new contributions which finally spirals us out of the same old Cycles and leads to new progress
      - I use archive.org as the example but you could equally do something like contribute knowledge to Wikimedia projects. I just like archive.org because you don't have to prove notability or existing sources, you can just upload "original research" if you want to
    - the other implication of encouraging people to create for a commons is encouraging the individualistic petty bourgeoisie or "microbourgeoisie" of platforms like YouTube to proletarianise and begin to resist the way things used to be done at this 'job' and devise new ways.
  - I think the main effect of these kinds of things might really just be that when they see them more people want to make /anything/, whether they quite understand my "commons" or "proletarianisation" concepts. and that might be good enough as long as they apply the "dialectic" part.
- in the long term, we want to increasingly break out of this Cyclical aspect of Production and simply be allowed to make more elaborate and thoughtful things that are not so limited by "Production Cycles" of both literal Bourgeois Production and informal Production environments like newsfeeds.
  - in the short term we have to 'obey' the Cyclical to successfully Produce, but in the long term we want the Dialectical to win so we can Produce /better/.

clearly, this idea of embracing Production Cycles takes place /before/ Continuous Production, where some hypothetical project is "finished" in a rolling-release kind of way and the maintainers work on it continuously while continuously getting feedback.
within the era of capitalism, many people will have to realise that while they wanted to do Continuous Production, it's not really feasible compared to this kind of Cyclic Production, and they really need to simply focus on small atomic Finished Products which can be completed without outside input if they want to be sure anything will get finished and released to the public.
this includes left-wing theory and propaganda works.
- don't "publish a theory book". create several small Finished videos or posts over the long period you're creating your book, because each one is more likely to get finished /and/ more likely to reach people.
  - the Lacanian channel "theory pleeb" was so close to /maybe/ discovering this "tyranny of Cyclic Production" idea, but instead got bogged down on the general idea of "time"

- if you find it annoying that Cyclic Production is the only way, agitate for an end to capitalism so that we can conceptualise and plan work on bases other than Marketing discrete Finished Products, we can smash the stupid competition-up-timelines-between-Finished-Products, and more people will get to do Continuous Production.


## dialectical cooperation and the YouTube Algorithm **

for a long time I racked my brain about the relationship of the YouTube Algorithm to Bolshevism.
because the YouTube Algorithm was a very weird thing. there were bad things about it but seemingly also very good and underappreciated things about it.


I think you cannot really end unnecessary competition or violence /by/ segregating people into separate environments, because in each case people will always discover they're part of the same world and affect each other.

applying this concept to ideologies and right-wing "echo chambers",
the YouTube Algorithm is the kind of structure that is maybe a third of the way to solving this problem — but no more.
on YouTube, everybody is simply encouraged to Post, and Post whatever. you can post a craft tutorial, or a Marxist idea, or almost whatever you want to within certain boundaries.
but if a video comes up in your recommendations that is somehow objectionable, there's a whole lot less you can do to contribute to YouTube in order to "make bad ideas go away".


opportunism is undialectical
because you don't even get cooperation much less progress

only dialectical cooperation breaks competition
