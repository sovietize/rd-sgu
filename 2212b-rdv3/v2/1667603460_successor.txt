# successors to corporations


## non-corporations

what is the actual purpose of a corporation?
arguably, it's a primitive economic government structure used to initially build part of an economy.

centuries ago, you had to found an oil company to create the American oil industry or whatever. people would found three telephone or internet companies and over time the various companies that existed would all merge into The Telecommunications Industry owned by one group of people (perhaps with some fake duopoly of exactly two phone carriers so nobody sees the whole thing is just one entity).

but at a certain point around the 1990s or 2000s corporations became "platforms" and every startup would show up with an internet platform for its users to operate day-to-day — facebook, meetup, deviantart, livejournal, ebay, just endless piles of these services where effectively users do most of the work
- and the weirdest part was these were /not/ profitable, they would often close or get bought out after a few years, but they still kept popping up over and over again.
- thus the so-called "dot-com bubble/boom" feels like the perfect demonstration that corporations are really just economic governments begging to serve people and accumulate 'citizens'.
  - all society is shaped by the fact we have to be accepted by others to meaningfully be part of society, but corporations in particular primarily face a pressure to /be useful/ as services in order to continue to exist.
  - the Liberal understanding that corporations "must be profitable" or "must get paying customers" is actually quite wrong, as corporate services like YouTube can stay open on nothing but advertisers deciding they're useful and deciding to fund them.

what's more, at a certain point people got tired of /corporate/ platforms and started imitating the same "platform startup" structure with completely community-run / volunteer projects such as Wikipedia and the fediverse. there were piles and piles of these as well!
at this point an entirely new thing had been created which was an economic organisation with a clearly-defined purpose producing Stuff but where nobody necessarily got paid — nor was there even any /monetary valuation/ of things — unless the purpose of the platform was to allow users to sell something
in cases like mastodon and peertube, these projects would even have "backend engineers" who would program the platform's software or troubleshoot its bugs and not get paid.

this brings up a serious question of if workers' states up to now did not properly anticipate what the expansion or turnover of an economy actually looks like.
- in the time of the Soviet Union it was assumed you would need formal government ministries to coordinate the economy (though this had multiple reasons, like that they hardly /had/ an economy at the beginning)
- then countries like China saw that "state capitalism" was more effective and simply allowed corporations to form and build parts of the economy
- meanwhile capitalist empires gloated that their unregulated corporations were making so much money, trying to act like they were the only real option, and also eventually saw the rise of a bunch of for-profit and non-profit "platforms"

so what if fundamentally the rule of thumb is that any economy grows or changes through discrete Projects in the vein of Google or Wikipedia, and the role of a workers' state should be to shepherd the Projects into some kind of order and watch them merge into non-profit monopolies themselves rather than to focus on formally establishing "ministries" or "state industries" that will replace Projects?
the transition away from for-profit corporations would then be to non-profit Projects.

the Soviet Union could not have foreseen platforms
if you had tried to explain to them people would just make wikipedia and /nobody/ would be paid they would probably find that surprising. they always went by these assumptions you had to have like, an era of socialism where you have a publisher and a fair wage to get everyone to write that much stuff that everyone else would also find useful every day. but that isn't the way things have shaped up; instead people create giant volunteer projects /first/ and they they fall apart or stagnate because people can't get compensated or even find a sufficient day job

it's very strange. early communist writers always assumed the problem would be getting people to work and take initiative and you had to create a society that would encourage it.
but instead it seems like things have developed backwards and we've all gotten stuck in this stranglehold of capitalism where so many of us have all the motivation in the world to build something and innovate but we can't get compensated because everything is spread apart and privatised (and poisoned by this notion of competition-as-democracy where projects getting no feedback is seen as a personal failing) so we really need some kind of system of planning and coordination so we can get compensated and obtain jobs we will actually have any will to be productive at
