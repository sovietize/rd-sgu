# "ideology"


## virtualisation

in the United States and (probably to a lesser extent) similar countries,
people have become so atomised and isolated that they build their whole entire mental model of the world around themself, and a short distance away from themself.
(I at first wrote "themselves" but really, a singular "themself" drives the point home even better.)

I will call this "virtualisation", or specifically, "virtualising the whole world into your head".
- people start their model with their own immediate experiences of their life and the people around them, and then have to address the giant gaps across the whole rest of the world with things like assumptions, stereotypes, their parents' ideology, inferences, factual reference works if they're lucky, internet anecdotes about other people's experiences, etc, and thus construct the whole rest of the world from giant uncertainties or simply nothing.
- but the key thing is /nobody knows they're doing this/ before the age of maybe 25 or so. they think their created virtual world /is/ the world, and in some cases may get upset if somebody challenges it.
- one could say it's a bit like "The Matrix", only everybody creates their own Matrix tailored to their own life experiences and hopes for what's true.
  - sometimes I phrase things as "the person becoming virtualised", and this means the same thing as "virtualising the world". although it can imply a more severe case

examples of virtualisation:

- a theist has "personal experiences of God" and believes this experience represents reality for everybody on earth, then goes through life believing anybody else on earth could experience their specific god
- a conservative has never actually met any real "leftists" and only run into one annoying university professor, and comes to believe all "leftists" in the world are annoying professors that want to "destroy America"
- a racist has literally never met any black people and sees one news report about one criminal in one poor neighbourhood and comes to believe all poor neighbourhoods in the world are out to get everybody and all they do is generate crimes
- a Liberal has never experienced finding capitalism completely and utterly intolerable and builds a model that they will never get into one of these situations where they cannot tolerate some section of capitalist Jobs or capitalist Products whatsoever, and which neglects the possibility that if this is the case for anybody else in the world it has anything to do with them
  - a Liberal has never met any communists and always assumes very weird things about what that means, informing their model of what all the other people in the country "getting organised" would look like and what ideology those people should have
  - a syndicalist hasn't talked to very many marginalised people and assumes the whole world is only full of one kind of working class and if you just get all the workers into harmony they cannot simply oppress each other, the people who think the "White Working Class" can't hold the others hostage and force unnecessary conservatism on the movement are just complaining
- an anarchist has a great plan to fix a local area and turn it anticapitalist but totally has not visualised the rest of the country around it or the rest of the world, and assumes that no possibility lies within the outer world of a fascist empire coming along and conquering their country or neoliberal countries fucking up the climate so much their area gets destroyed by the climate and anarchism has been mooted
- a Trotskyist learns about a specific "expert" that other people haven't been talking about and becomes convinced everybody would agree this is the best expert out there if they could just come to the same understanding; without knowing anybody else's mind or experiences they proceed to assume nobody of any other ideology or Trotskyist "section" could have a better understanding
- in the literal Stalin era, a peasant gets convinced that the Communist Party's policies are actually good although they aren't and virtualises the world as all the capitalist policies in other countries being doomed while collective farms are not

- while many of these examples seem to just describe "overgeneralisation", what's important is what happens /after/ the overgeneralisation. in each case the person has formed an entire mental model of the world which will be applied to everything they do in their life — this is how the world has been "virtualised".
- it's also true /anybody/ can make an error of virtualisation. Marxist-Leninists, literally anybody. it's not as if virtualisation is a "characteristic of flawed ideologies" that are worse than the best one. it can coincide with and undermine the best ideology imaginable and weaken that one.

how virtualisation can create serious problems:

- if somebody has virtualised the world around micro-/petty-/lumpenbourgeois status, where even if they see themself as a worker they believe their life goal should be upgrading to the next tier of bourgeoisie, they may focus on their own advancement before focusing on organising and solidarity, but either way, they won't be able to properly conceptualise a labour movement around shared proletarian status because they will always cling to bourgeois attitudes and concepts. until you get the lower bourgeoisie to genuinely give up bourgeois status and "aspire" to be proletarians, they cannot conceptualise what that even /is/ much less how to unify everyone around it.
- if somebody has virtualised the world as Marxism being a certain thing it's not, or it only being about a small subset of what it's about and other factors as being more important, they may conceptualise an entirely different kind of future revolution such as a "postcolonial anti-racist revolution", and it will be hard to get them to organise around and "do anything about" the same material goals as Marxists have because they have created entirely different goals
  - it must be stated that anti-racism is not a problem. but many of these ideas seem to totally ignore capitalism and capitalists as a factor in "colonialism"
  - it seems like while US communists have tried to envision a coalition for opposing capitalism that would in the short term push for economic reforms, anti-racism has tried to envision a transformation solely about racism that would in the short term push for small reforms about racism. this isn't alarming /until/ you realise 'small reforms about racism' aren't shaking the material basis for fascism and the worst racism
- if somebody has virtualised the world as the COVID pandemic being over and it's not, you can't organise people for better disease prevention measures and they may reject you for having the 'wrong' model of the world as if you are the stupid one

one of the most unintuitive results of virtualisation is Lacanianism.
in this ideology, /everything/ begins and ends with a model of a single mind, as if the theorist's mind exists before any other part of the world, and the /only/ part of reality that really feeds into human behaviour is the perceptions in individuals' minds.
this is basically an Idealist model of reality, where a virtual field of 'minds' shapes the material reality. but Lacanians have trouble noticing this because they try to cover it up by narrowing their theory, and claiming things like that it only covers /social phenomena/ and everything else is material and works a different way.
in this way I think there is a possibility Lacanianism could further feed virtualisation if it's not careful — and racism, and queerphobia, and fascism, and everything else that sits on it.

importantly, the point of identifying "virtualisation" is not that every human being is required to know everything about the world. this is impossible.
instead, the near-opposite of virtualisation is Materialism.
- we could get rid of virtualisation and have it cease to be a problem if we could manage to get every political group to be Materialist, accumulating some particular set of factual knowledge that will combine into one shared understanding. if this were possible, one big non-specific "Left Coalition" could easily unite to stop the entire far-right.
- but one reason this hasn't already happened is that "non-Marxist" ideologies often have a nasty problem of ending up /non-Materialist/, and through too narrow a focus, accidentally creating a virtualised understanding of reality. even if you combine all these virtual worlds they will not necessarily be close enough to the real one.
- one way to fight virtualisation is teaching people about history and the history of different countries.
  - it's key to get people to understand the people of other countries and time periods as /human beings/ that they could have existed alongside, rather than inhabitants of a separate reality just because they were in another country or time period.
  - this is part of why I keep turning Trotsky into a weird instrument of Marxism-Leninism likely against his wishes. he is the perfect way to begin understanding his time period at a human level and "reopening" the discussions going on at that time without forgetting correct conclusions of them.


## ideologies

in many of these sections it may seem like I've slipped into talking about "ideology" and claiming that "ideology" keeps people from organising
but really, I don't see those parts as a theory of "ideology" as much as /maybe/ a theory of material factors that lead people to having ideologies or not reflecting on why they have them. it's all about material things like people and incentives and how you should more closely examine those systems of material things

I think that ideologies are their own phenomenon of a plurality of belief systems, formed from something like the interaction between an individual's goals and their material circumstances.
- ideologies are a normal part of how individual human beings operate and understand the world, not some kind of unnatural thing only created by Ideological State Apparatuses in a particular economic system or something
  - essentially I think there is no meaningful distinction between "ideology"/"ideologies" and "philosophy"/"philosophies". all philosophy is a subset of ideology, as is all religion, all ethics, and maybe /all opinion statements/.
  - I half want to say that ideology is the basic top-level category for all beliefs, in the sense Tetrapods are the top-level category for things like dogs and birds. birds are a very specific thing but lobe-finned fish are the foundation on which birds exist
- for me Heidegger's idea of Dasein or 'authentic being' easily leads to a model of ideological factions if you correct it.
  - people have individual preferences and goals before they even enter into society, and once they compare existing in nature with existing in human society, they will decide which of their goals are more important than other people's or which they can cooperate on and thus form at least a simple ideology
  - "inauthentic being" is nothing more than two people's sets of goals maturing into different ideologies and existing together uneasily.

- ideologies have a phenomenon of "entireness" where there really are boundaries between one specific ideology and another specific ideology; Liberalism is not anarchism is not communism is not theocratic Toryism
  - this is to say, people really do cross lines to new ideologies and don't always just gradually drift into a new ideology by picking up little pieces and then labelling it (although this can happen)
  - another way to say "Entireness" is "coherence". ideologies are commonly a /coherent/ set of /connected/ beliefs.
  - one could even use the phrase "Entire With" and say parts of Liberalism are Entire With certain other parts, where if you don't drop that whole network of parts they'll bring along the others even as you think you've created a new left-wing ideology.
- ideologies and social networks are not fully intertwined but may be at least a little inseparable, connected to the phenomenon of Entire ideologies.
  - individuals may feel like they have to cling to one Entire connected set of positions with all its limitations and baggage and can't cross the line to a new ideology because of their current social network
  - crossing to a new ideology can be correlated with leaving behind one network of people who simply weren't listening and seeking a new network of people — although the causal relationship can go either way. you change your ideology and have to rupture or you rupture and then are able to change ideologies

- a belief that ideologies are never Entire or are rarely Entire can lead people to nasty mistakes around ideologies, like thinking you can just accept/condone "part of" American conservatism and the rest of it won't come along for the ride, or that people in a workers' state like North Korea can label a number of arbitrary small things from different causes "bourgeois ideology!" and begin persecuting them when they are not signs of anything in particular
  - this isn't to say that, for instance, when you have a little conservatism you necessarily have an Entire specific conservatism, but you do have an Entire whatever-ideology-you-have.
  - said another way, if you pick one position out of an ideology it often has baggage in the form of other related positions. even if it seems like an intermediate, "apolitical" ideology, it may be Entire in this way, and if you naïvely assume it's compatible with your ideology because of one issue you could create a red-brown alliance
  - right-wing dogwhistles exploit the general failure to understand and properly act on Entireness of ideologies, where people assume everyone always chooses individual positions one-by-one. an Entire conservative ideology of many connected points is crammed into one short phrase and pushed through because there is no universal social convention allowing you to simply call out "Entire! Entire right-wing ideology!"

the significance of ideologies to Marxism and economics is that they are a kind of bridge between individuals and the rest of society.
ideologies represent pockets of people settling onto the same decisions and strategies, but each pocket independently of the others and not in a coordinated way throughout all of society. in order to organise people, you will always have to deal with these pockets of ideology, potentially as a way to unify people, potentially as an obstacle.
- in this way, philosophies like Lacanianism make a critical mistake by trying to act like it's possible to /not/ have pockets of ideology and we just need to eradicate them and do everything at the individual level. if you do that, you may be attacking the whole basis for any kind of change.
- one of the very few genuine indisputable points Trotskyism can claim is that Stalin's government did not understand how to throw away ideologies without throwing away people. one big reason you cannot simply get Trotskyism to "stop" is most current ideologies find it hard to prove to them society won't turn on them and oppress them without them being very loud about whatever so they can't be successfully "thrown away"


## interfactionalism

I have been contemplating whether we need to create a concept that's like intersectionality but for ideologies.
literally it would mean that one ideology doesn't exclude others from being a member of its faction as long as they are largely compatible
but the true significance would be like, one ideology has a certain list of issues, and the other ones allow those issues in at least as its question if not its answer. this way, intersectionality itself can happen almost trivially as the right "historicist ideologies" are allowed into the faction, but issues that aren't so tied to identity politics can also come up

this would stop Lacanianism dead in the water because one of its biggest complaints is that movements exclude too many people from their movements.
however an "interfactional" movement would invite Lacanians in if they can propose at least one actually concrete and useful suggestion (please)
likewise it /might/ be a possible way to deprogram Trotskyists and some kinds of anarchists from their errors without risking that organisations simply dissolve and people lose momentum.
- a difference between what is done now and "interfactional communism" is it would explicitly try to listen to and integrate other sects if they can produce /anything correct/ instead of merely telling them they have the wrong ideology and effectively to go away
- interfactionalism is definitely one of the many concepts where I'm not saying it's a new discovery — I mean, I think the Bolsheviks literally in fact did it for a given definition of it — only that the people of the United States are so stupid and uninformed you need to name it and describe it in words before they'll have ever thought of it.

interfactionalism should never be an excuse for class collaboration or red-brown alliances.
the purpose is to end up with as many correct ideas and as few false ideas as possible.


## the spiral dialectic **


the failure to understand dialectics is the failure to understand change itself

Rothenberg demonstrates a seemingly common mistake about Hegelian dialectics

the dialectic goes around one cycle where the system functions one way, and then at some point the parts interact in ways that actually change the system, and it spirals up to the next cycle where it may consistently function another way for a while
- all the parts of the system are always doing something, so they all have to line up acting some roughly 'correct' way /at once/ for the system to change.

we have to keep in mind the spiral dialectic whenever we want to improve movements or a state of unnecessary fighting between movements
whatever we're doing the pattern is likely to be that it will be unclear if things are working for a little while until suddenly the system hits the spiral point and we see it improving
