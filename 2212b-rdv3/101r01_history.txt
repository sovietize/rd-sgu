'the story so far'

Marx tries to figure out where capitalism came from, came up with a reasonable history
economy begins dying while Marx is alive
collapses of WWI
Bolsheviks rebuild russia
germany collapses further and becomes Nazi Germany
First - Second - Third - "Fourth"
Trotsky comes up with a crazy idea you can stop Nazi Germany from inside. it doesn't work
axis powers thwacked with military force to end fascism
postmodern period - "the victors" of history redefine the goal as stopping fascism rather than stopping societal collapse and improving society, so Nazism and Bolshevism are thrown in the same bin because Bolshevism tried to do something other than Stop Fascism
fascism is back.... and our only discovered solution is to thwack it with military force so what are we going to do about that
now we have Marxism and a bunch of other unrelated ideologies starting from completely different places, and we had better find the right ideas quickly

the old saying was "you have nothing to lose but your chains"
the stakes are really high now
whenever a communist movement screws up everyone hates communism a bit more. likewise with every ideology there is. when anarchism screws up people hate anarchism, when Trotskyism or Lacanianism screw up people hate those
the good news is that when conservatism makes a mess of the world people hate conservatism.
however, it's no longer enough to fight like we have nothing to lose when there are now so many ideologies and so many still-unsolved questions that have been uncovered.
if we all fight like we have nothing to lose, but we fight each other, we all lose.

workers, find the right way, if we fight for the wrong things, we have a world to lose
