the Third International or comintern was dissolved in 1939
a number of people think this was a bad thing

but Mao posited that there didn't need to be a Third International any more?? at least in the 1940s
this confuses me. i don't know if it's right or wrong
is it an error for there to be a Fourth International because you don't need a Third International???
