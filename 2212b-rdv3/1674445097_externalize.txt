markets as externalizing civilization errors onto the individual
/ "the invisible hand mostly swats people"


a civilization error has been defined as when one part of civilization continues in a direction separate from the others and creates an incomplete slice of civilization which does not make the rest of civilization more functional and wastes resources


as capitalism develops, small clumps of civilization grow through the Market
people are asked to develop a good or service for the surrounding civilization in order to trade it for other wants and needs
however, they are never given enough information to know for sure if the thing they have decided to develop is the right one. no matter how sure they are and how much they have researched it is possible their contribution will not sell and they will have used resources and received no compensation or recognition

every time an entrepreneur or worker-owner makes an error this is an individual making a civilization error.


in capitalism we hid this process inside corporate bureaucracies, where whenever somebody signs up for a job it's possible the manager or owner will make the civilization error for them and the enterprise loses money and they perhaps lose their job
but should people manage to break free from working for a capitalist, they have to face civilization errors themselves and directly face the consequences for making one.



the smartest worker would try to choose a job to minimize civilization errors
they would ask, what do people want me to produce and about how much, so I don't waste anything. hey, before I waste a lot of time and energy on excess capacity or training, what would actually benefit people?

but the social structure created by Liberal capitalism doesn't give us the capability to do this effectively
people are spread apart, they are thrown against each other, socialization is a competition to become the most legitimate, democratic elections are a competition to control everybody else
it's difficult to get such a request to the right people or get people to listen to it unless you're already partway on top of the background competition and thus already synergizing with civilization

the system throws requirements onto you and you only have any idea what they are if you've already managed to meet them and receive a positive reward, otherwise it simply tosses you out until you meet the invisible requirements and make it in
the invisible hand mostly swats people.






overshoot theory explanation here

this characteristic of civilization errors is why Overshoot Theory cannot be correct
the civilization error is the unit of Overshoot
however civilization errors occur because people are not coordinated. it is not what people are positively doing but what they are /not/ doing.
thus it is difficult to find out how to stop doing Overshoot if it is supposedly the fundamental problem, because people were never "doing" Overshoot, but were /not preventing/ Overshoot from naturally popping up out of the way the system is set up.

if Overshoot were the fundamental problem we might expect that a one-child policy would have real effects on Overshoot by stretching out the earth's carrying capacity
but the problem keeps coming back even if we limit population
this suggests Overshoot is actually a product of the way a particular number of people are arranged to regenerate civilization and not a product of too much of any particular thing such as people or consumption
Overshoot Theory would suggest that the problem is how human populations regenerate humans, but the problem is clearly inside how humans regenerate civilization
