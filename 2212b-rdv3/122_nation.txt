## "national identity"

the framings typically used to discuss the "division" and disintegration of the United States are frankly awful

one that comes up is "national identity"
that the United States "is divided over its national identity" or "only has a national identity in political terms and this is clearly why politics tear the country apart"   [*rc]

this seems to me like a very non-Materialist way to study the United States.
if you want to solve the problem of the United States never really having been a particular American civilization for a continuous period of time, it seems like that should have been solved in 1700 rather than today, so that over the next 300 years the US could form a coherent identity and establish itself as "American civilization". but it did not do this in real life.
if the United States couldn't form a unified identity of this particular kind over /200 years/, how long does that process even take, and how is it relevant to discussing the United States at all?

it seems like if you want to concern yourself with nationalities, you should think about the way the United States was simply planted on another continent around 1600 severing itself from the main British civilization - if we choose to see that event from just the US perspective rather than all the other people "affected" by it in North America, Africa, and so forth.
it seems like there is a clear proximate cause for why the United States is not "a continuous American civilization", which is British and other-European settlers choosing to leave Europe and sever themselves from their previous civilizations and nationalities.

we could imagine that if British settlers had wanted to solve the problem of "unified American identity" in the 1600s they might stand up against the British monarchy itself and continue to be British people who claim the British isles as their land they were born on and not the land of monarchy or theocracy or other oppressions that claim a right to that land over its own people. they might create a "US declaration of independence" inside Britain, or if its colonies still exist, one that extended through Britain and also the United States at once.


there is no "Western Civilization"!
you can subjectively claim there is "Western culture" and that the Roman Empire is tenuously connected to later "Western cultures" by threads of geography and borrowing.
but today, past about the year 1600, "Western civilization" was already destroyed a long time ago - there is only capitalist civilization bounded by national borders.




'china unified on one set of political values, Communism'
quite an admission
'however, it still had an existing history of being the Chinese people in a particular region for thousands of years'

china agreed to be one Chinese civilization - but the key word in that statement is /civilization/, not /Chinese/.
communist china is at its core a united group of industries and material institutions of everyday life

people like Orwell and Rand got so upset that the Bolsheviks couldn't successfully build civilization, and tried to spin it as that they weren't /qualified/ for the task of building civilization.
/maybe so./
however, this discussion exposes the fact that in the modern era after monarchy and feudalism all political parties now compete for the task of building modern civilization - industries, jobs, schools, transportation,

PragerU makes such a big deal out of the Communist Manifesto talking about "credit", "transport", and "".
this idea might sound alien if you didn't think the task of a political party was to build civilization, but if you do, it would be an obvious talking point.

Marx did not live in a democracy. he lived in a kingdom. the moment he wrote about parliaments rather than economics, he recognized that the United States was further along at building a republic and building a civilization, and assumed that the United States had brighter prospects than Germany.

the Bolsheviks did not live in a democracy. they lived in a theocratic monarchy. much of their early writings are about how Russia barely had capitalist industry and instead it had aristocrats taking up the land with manors and vast church properties and a lot of social structures simply designed to oppress people and uphold the monarchy while preventing any kind of democracy.

there is a pattern across both of these. neither of these countries was filled with modern civilization (in the way the United States was even by 1900), and the people were upset that they did not really /have/ the things PragerU is so concerned about the government taking. therefore the communist parties had to take up the task of /building/ civilization, either by the state creating industry, or creating corporations that would create industry, as in China.

arguably, this conflict between being the communist party with its particular goals and having to build industries heavily strained the task of building socialism in the USSR and even in China by introducing too much capitalism. but the idea of whether capitalist Industries and building a better civilization are entirely opposite to each other is a complicated topic which will be discussed in another section.



## intersectionality

an explanation of what intersectionality is does not truly belong in a theory of Marxism. but this is one of those places where the United States is just so stupid you have to explicitly explain it

you need to start with a movement that is for everybody at least on paper
then you need to make it Truly for everybody using principles of intersectionality

you can't "go for more voters" by creating an agenda specifically tailored for "The White Working Class" in some gentrified suburb area just so those people will vote.

it's amazing, some people will claim that the Bolsheviks were a small group of people taking over a greater country and that was bad because they weren't "a broad coalition", but then people will try to suggest that Liberalism needs to hang on by trying to appease really specific groups of people instead of going for a broad coalition of different demographics
