no human being is neutral
which is to say, separate from the political issues they speak about if they are part of the same wider group of people such as the same country
it is impossible to get an entirely "unbiased" view on something because the structure of society itself prevents such a thing.
the dialectical connections between human beings mean that any particular person with a view on something always exists in relation to the other people affected by that particular view on that issue


do you want the truth about Stalin's government
this truth cannot be obtained independent of the structure of Soviet society


commonly people in the United States and Britain will try to assess the Soviet Union as if its people don't actually get an opinion about whether it was good
Stalin's government exists independently of its people and independently of the rest of the world
and only outside countries and external actors get to decide whether this government is good or bad
but that is not the way things worked in the real world

we can begin to see why Liberalism has such a tendency to squash democratic republics in other countries
there is a mistaken idea that external countries are the ultimate arbiter of whether a country gets to have a given leader, not voters inside the country
democracy is always under threat when Liberalism exists because the basic principles of democracy, that the people inside the country run the democratic process, are quickly violated as soon as one country does something inconvenient for another country's economy

there is almost a hidden shred of dialectical thinking buried deep inside Liberalism - it manages to realise that Liberal democracy in one country is not enough and we always have to consider the relationships between countries in order to operate Liberal democracy.



recently somebody called Grover Furr collected new evidence released about the Trotskyite conspiracy
who /is/ Grover Furr
we can't fully evaluate whether he is presenting true or false information without knowing his relationship to the Soviet Union, communism, and anticommunism
