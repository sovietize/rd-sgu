"blobonomics"


i'm giving a name to the lacanian idea you have to run civilization on principles of the Unconscious
when you use this for economics, it is now called blobonomics


a video platform pops up
all the discussion about it becomes about whether this is going to be jobs
then it's going to compete with other things for workers. workers will go here instead of somewhere else to get work
however everybody becomes involved in this complicated conversation of is it good to lead workers here so they can get work or should they all tank this platform and go find work elsewhere

in the time of blobonomics it is hard to organize workers because we have turned the entire discussion into how corporations and industries should be arranged, something that most people don't actually have any control over unless there was a workers' state
if people don't have any commitment to building a stable institution and always simply step over to another one, they have no commitment to standing up for themselves against the problems of that institution


another subtle form of blobonomics is when people start backing specific countries usually against the united states, saying they should build up their economy and that will be enough to change the world
this is blobonomics because it suggests people can just "step over to" another country instead of fixing problems with the first one, and as long as they all "step over onto" that country the task of building a better country and industries there is bound to sort itself out somehow
