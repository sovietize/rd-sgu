infinite businesses thought experiment


interactions always have a certain monopolistic quality to them from the very beginning
once you establish a given interaction you might not be able to establish the same interaction a second time
for instance, once a consumer starts buying a product, you can't get that consumer to /newly/ start buying that product a second time


if we tried to turn everyone into a business we would eventually stretch thin how many customers there could possibly be for each business
we typically think about this as supply and demand, or if we want to be more sophisticated, total supply of products versus individual supplies of products,
but this is inseparable from the overall social graph where each connection between individuals or small groups takes away some amount of opportunity for other connections

however, if people naturally "blob" into larger businesses to the detriment of small ones, it takes longer for this to become a real problem in the same way
it is possible for there to be so many connections per big business that there is too much space between businesses and people in the in-between space actually can't find a business when they want one
but when businesses get this big it is more likely they will start creating some kind of chain stores to fill in the gaps
in this way, any business can become an increasingly important social institution, but most cannot, as the link established between the chain and customers is a social connection into the physical neighborhood and the fabric of civilization, which to some extent inherently prevents new businesses from taking up the same links

this is to say, whether we go in with this goal or not, at some point "free enterprise" must stop and "operating civilization" must begin.
the "free enterprise" of a few people to accumulate things for themselves does not make for a civilization of a lot of people, even a Western civilization
civilization always consists of a wide mass of individuals operating and setting into place all of the various material necessities and useful institutions of daily life, as well as connections between human beings which give meaning and purpose to any of this work.
society is the collective effort of all individuals interacting, in which encouraging some individuals to expand and expand their territories detracts from the actual interactive activity of coordinating a functional civilization



marxism would probably be greatly improved by using another kind of mathematics more like graph theory
in this way we might be better able to understand the growth of civilizations over time and their evolution into different possible forms without focusing on only desirable possibilities
