# on economic work

how do we change the United States, britain, or canada?
we go to work.
it may sound boring or unpleasant
but the key is to become part of society and the projects or organizations everyone uses - to be sighted producing real improvements to technology, science, etc which are not inherently political until capitalism claims there's something wrong with them


(mao and mobilizing the early communist party of china to produce useful work to help the people)  [*MW]


'but won't i get fired if i try to propose improvements and the organization doesn't want to improve'
maybe, but you have to do it anyway
