# Could Trotsky build a civilization? a thought experiment

I know how to stop there from ever having been Trotskyism.   [*a]
If we're in about the year 1929 or so,   [*e]
you take Trotsky, you put him in his own teeny tiny autonomous republic — which is maybe about the size of Rhode Island in the United States — and this will be /his/ republic, where any and all Trotskyists can live.   [*assr,*ri]

But here's the thing — there is pretty much nothing there when they get there and they have to build everything.

They can be exempt from all the major times they'd run into "the corrupt bureaucracy" of the higher levels of government, but they have to build everything themselves. And they will solely be responsible for it.   [*g1,*g2]

My logic here is that, I think you learn a lot from being stuck in a situation where you have nobody else to cooperate with and you have to build everything by yourself.
	(illus.: "1632" by Eric Flint)   [*f,*f2,*f3]

I think in essence this is actually what it means to be a worker —   [*w]
by default, only your own skills can get you what you want, unless you want to compromise your values and work for a capitalist or something to obtain the things you want.
If you want to build something that's /not/ capitalism, you're really really going to have to look for people who actually want to cooperate with you to do the huge amount of work that's required to build it.

I personally learned this from my own experiments in wanting better computers and better art. I kept finding that people just didn't aspire to anything better than what capitalism gives us, and the only way to have things was to build them myself.   [*gnu]

So... yeah.
Because of this, I like to imagine situations where we attempt to make Trotsky learn how to do ordinary work.
	(illus.: construction.jpg)
Do you think it would teach him to have better models of reality and how industries work?
If he was in a situation where he was entirely responsible, and he couldn't wreck things or sabotage production, and if he doesn't do the work /Trotskyism dies/. Do you think he would learn something?

I'd just love to know how this would go.
You put Trotsky in his own autonomous republic and the Trotskyists really have to build a Trotskyist workers' state instead of just sabotaging the Soviet Union. Do you think they could do it?
How do you think it would turn out? What do you think it would look like if they were able to build it?

As far as I'm concerned, Trotskyist responses are just fine.
I've just had a lot of trouble wrapping my head around what Trotskyism is actually supposed to look like when you build it. So if anybody thinks they know and would like to explain it to me, that would be awesome.

So, yeah. What do you think would happen?

## Description

I have always been extremely curious what would have happened if Trotsky actually got the chance to build a workers' state, but simply in another area not controlled by the "Stalinist bureaucracy". Were his ideas actually coherent? If he was not asked to rebel against Stalin but simply to build a functional workers' state on his own with nothing stopping him, could he actually do it?

I know that there might already be answers to these questions at least for modern Trotskyist movements, but the thing is: I had been periodically reading about Trotsky seriously trying to understand what he was getting at for about a year or something, and I still don't understand what it was he wanted people to do and what he would have considered a good outcome. It seemed to me like there were multiple incidents where he thought he wanted one thing and then got upset when it was actually done because that wasn't the thing he actually wanted and he had not done a good job defining what it was he really meant.


I should probably make it very clear: I would not be in favor of, for instance, rounding up _modern_ Trotskyists and shoving them in a new US state as soon as "Stalinism" wins. I consider the 1930s "Trotskyite conspiracy" and modern Trotskyism to be two different things, and I am talking about the former — which for one thing emerged inside a workers' state, and for another, emerged while the region was still developing and creating new administrative divisions. The point of the scenario is also more to give Trotsky some kind of chance to resolve his conflict peacefully than to punish him.

(That said, I'm going to explore a scenario of Trotskyists deciding on their own they're going to try to control a particular US state in another video.)

[*a] I did not mean this very seriously.

[*w] Obviously this is not the core definition of "worker", only a thing it entails.

[*e] At some point in 1928 (I was one year off), Trotsky was exiled to Alma-Ata in modern-day Kazakhstan, where he was allowed to be for about one year until he was banished from the Soviet Union in 1929. I don't think that time looked much like what I'm describing here.

[*f] "This is a book by a Trotskyist where basically United States people have to do what I'm describing, but it's modern people sent to 1632. Sadly I have not read it"
