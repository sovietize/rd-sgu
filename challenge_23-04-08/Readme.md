## Original description

I have always been extremely curious what would have happened if Trotsky actually got the chance to build a workers' state, but simply in another area not controlled by the "Stalinist bureaucracy". Were his ideas actually coherent? If he was not asked to rebel against Stalin but simply to build a functional workers' state on his own with nothing stopping him, could he actually do it?

I know that there might already be answers to these questions at least for modern Trotskyist movements, but the thing is: I had been periodically reading about Trotsky seriously trying to understand what he was getting at for about a year or something, and I still don't understand what it was he wanted people to do and what he would have considered a good outcome. It seemed to me like there were multiple incidents where he thought he wanted one thing and then got upset when it was actually done because that wasn't the thing he actually wanted and he had not done a good job defining what it was he really meant.


I should probably make it very clear: I would not be in favor of, for instance, rounding up _modern_ Trotskyists and shoving them in a new US state as soon as "Stalinism" wins. I consider the 1930s "Trotskyite conspiracy" and modern Trotskyism to be two different things, and I am talking about the former â€” which for one thing emerged inside a workers' state, and for another, emerged while the region was still developing and creating new administrative divisions. The point of the scenario is also more to give Trotsky some kind of chance to resolve his conflict peacefully than to punish him.

(That said, I'm going to explore a scenario of Trotskyists deciding on their own they're going to try to control a particular US state in another video.)
