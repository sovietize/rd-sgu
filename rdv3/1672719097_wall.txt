the creation of towns and guilds was /splitting society apart/
it was the origin of the problem of people claiming they should have the freedom to not be subject to the rest of society, and of ordinary people having to appease somebody to enter society - usually an employer, but maybe Everybody's unreasonable demands for having 'normal' behavior

we thought it was a progressive force but it would come to tear society apart at the seams
it would come to create this blob of nazi reaction where a bunch of small owners try to resist everything else and forcefully claim their role in society while crushing Industry Blobs and everybody outside their 'town' of people that doesn't obey their particular claims to exclusive control
it would manifest itself as the blob of nazi reaction standing up to vaccines of all things as a threat to their exclusive control of their territory and over anybody who walked into it

we might be thinking about classes wrong.
the idea should be Private Property and enclosures, and we need to solve them spatially to solve the problem
the idea of class antagonisms abstracted the problem just a little bit too much although it was describing the same thing
