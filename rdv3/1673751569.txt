democracy should be defined as the coordination of spatial wills
that is, human goals or perspectives are distributed across space at particular locations, and if allowed to run around they eventually smash into each other possibly at each other's expense. but democracy is bringing the spatially distributed wills into cooperation so that they do not smash each other and instead coexist in a constructive and dialectical way
