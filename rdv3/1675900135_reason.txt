the dialectical process and reason


i don't like the framing of "human reason"
i don't feel like lining up marx as a continuation of Liberalism actually works
i don't think reason alone actually gets us anywhere or solves our problems
and this takes a while to explain



human beings value group membership and communities over facts
this is the mechanism by which we see people retreat into cults to get through difficult times - groups are the most important and we will immediately secure groups to keep us "safe" from everything outside the group before we pursue rational methods to improve the world
nothing else makes it easy to explain the anti-vaccine community other than it is a community of people that have flocked together out of the fear of everyone outside it to clumsily attempt to remedy the apparent harm of vaccines as a group

politics is really just one big hijacking of our human obsession with group membership to bring us on a roundabout path back to reason.
we are offered a group which is actually able to discuss real solutions to problems, and we begin to consider that a possibility again even if we started to think there are no clear solutions or no path to cooperation to solve this issue



in this way national territories, distinct from The State, are a consequence of trying to get large groups of people to cooperate on problems that parts of the larger whole cannot solve alone

why "Stalinism"? out of the assertion that different regions of a country actually do need each other.
without somehow coordinating themselves together as a national territory, regions may or may not establish the right patterns of trade and industry to sustain themselves
or they may do something harmful to other regions, like cut down a bunch of trees while this affects the planet as a whole so the other regions would not appreciate this



humans have an amazing capacity to reason, but they are very bad at coming to reason individually and spontaneously. 
they will only come to reason as part of a social process of forming into a group of people who would like to come to reason.
