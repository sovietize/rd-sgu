if communism isn't evil, then what is?


likely they will ask
"if communism isn't evil, then what is?"

the first thing to say is that this is probably the wrong question


evil is a concept groups of people independently create in their minds as they grow up
there are a few things that could be on almost everyone's list
but evil is a created concept
we have to look at situations from outside all the participating parties and simply look at what's happening
do we like what's happening or do we not like that thing and want to stop it

people build civilizations independently of each other in disconnected areas by assembling into civilization
but as civilizations get bigger and run into each other there are emergent effects and unexpected clashes of values
we cannot understand this from within a single civilization, we must step outside civilization

in a sense dialectical materialism must be beyond good and evil
but only because we are really bad at defining evil in a way which is universally useful


rule of thumb:
if you cannot possibly imagine a Communist united states as a neutral state of things that most people are not upset about and then define what is evil within that situation, you don't know how to define evil
