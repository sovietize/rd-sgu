lenin's filter from stupid people to vanguard

if people are tired of experts and don't trust them then you want to give more agency to the people
this is a basic democratic idea, we know that Liberal democracies are not actually very democratic
but how do you prevent this from leading to a Marjorie Taylor Greene or Lysenko

lenin explained in 1920 (and certainly before) that you prevent worker power from devolving into a bunch of stupid people or reactionaries in power by distinguishing between mass movements and the vanguard;
people will be able to filter up from the masses into the vanguard when they are capable of leading the workers


lenin's filter vs washington's filter

this is different from the concept in the early United States of deliberately trying to limit participation in democracy because the Bolsheviks actually wanted this to turn into more people participating as time went on. it was not intended to maintain separate strata of people indefinitely just because somebody thought that was the only way to keep a stable republic.
even in the later United States you see ideas of limiting the realm of democracy to some arbitrary value, there are the electoral college, the Senate, the House, etc., but bourgeois parties and their donors usually limit the candidates which there will actually be. the idea of expanding democracy from a small realm to a greater realm and potentially everybody one day is not present here. anyone can vote but many people cannot be represented for one reason or another and a lot of constituents desert the political parties or voting system as if it could never represent them. the parties don't increase in membership and sometimes they decrease.

maybe a note about "ancient greek voter suppression" courtesy of Aristotle


the next question is, when does the filter actually begin



> Those who are really convinced that they have made progress in science would not demand freedom for the new views to continue side by side with the old, but the substitution of the new views for the old.   [*s]

thing about wading through the marsh but not to stay there   [*s]
without a principled party all the parties end up copying empty slogans without understanding anything

spontaneity only got countries trade unions, and also took away anything more

socialism always comes from bourgeois class traitors and not out of spontaneity
agitators and propagandists - explain all strata of society to each other so they can unite

"hopeless amateurs" kept getting caught - they needed to combine into a greater organization and find competent revolutionaries




lenin explains the "root of police in oppression" for the russian empire and how this particular oppression can only be removed by replacing the bourgeois police with militias   [*w]
technically this cannot be called democracy because it is not a democratic monarchy that dominates the people





did the filter fail?
why was the later ussr like that and what happened to china
personally it seems to me like china is what you get when you admit everyone in too fast and start confusing a lot of members and class collaboration with progress. I definitely don't know this for sure




> Nowhere in the world do the workers’ parties unite groups of intellectuals and “trends”; they unite workers on the following terms: (1) recognition and application of definite Marxist decisions on questions of tactics and organisation; (2) submission of the minority of class-conscious workers to the majority.    [*a]




Rosa Luxemberg was partially against the idea of Lenin's filter
she thought that you could not build it from the beginning and only after getting a lot of quality proletarians into the party would the filter emerge and the party be able to guard against opportunism and bad ideas
this is probably wrong.
