we've misunderstood what The Bourgeoisie are and who they are

the conflict in the united states is to have finely-chopped civilization versus large connected civilization
some people want to chop up civilization really small into corporate civilizations consisting of one corporation and its connected families
other people want to create larger connected civilizations which span a city, a state, the whole United States
conspiracy theories allege that The Communists are still trying to connect the United States to other countries - although this isn't really happening any more with the fall of the Third International, the main mechanism by which this possibly could have happened. it's mostly just small corporate civilizations versus having a United States

the implication is this:
there is no colorado, there is no florida, there is no texas
there are a bunch of separate circuits of civilization with each person at some Job, and supposedly their separate individual actions will successfully produce a functional colorado, florida, or texas, but it's not working out
so our task is to CREATE colorado when it never truly existed
our task is to bring together a bunch of separate people to CREATE the unified colorado that never really was until now. to bring together the disparate people inside an area arbitrarily labelled florida to actually create florida




we've been misunderstanding the goal of a labor movement
workers shouldn't unite together to try to overthrow capitalists
workers should unite together to attempt to get their industry connected to another one. imagine videogame studios which are going through crunch, the workers should unite to push the studio to connect itself to other studios

it turns out that really big corporations are awfully likely to make choices that make conservatives mad
youtube has 'catered to the left!!' simply because it's really really big with a lot of people connected together
so it appears one way to defeat conservatism is just to merge industries together until they're that big and everybody obsessed with fracturing apart civilization and gaining power from being disconnected has no power any more



imperialism is double capitalism. it is two modes of production stacked together

imperialism
[ US
  [capitalists / disconnected + connected]
     /
     [colonized]    [capitalists / workers]
     Haiti etc      China etc]

imperialism confused people because it creates new relationships
in some countries the whole country gets progressively controlled by foreign capitalists, which progressively turns that country all into one class with the same relationship toward the external capitalists*, which allows them to all unite
but in other countries that doesn't happen and there are still enough internal antagonisms capitalism continues to develop
(* it isn't as important to label and characterize classes and the people that are in each class as it is to understand connected units joining together and their relationship to other connected units.)


there is really, like, a third class in the United States
it's complicated because every class can be lumpen or actively connected to society, and we shouldn't confuse lumpen with another tier
but assuming each one is connected
there is the capitalist, who owns and invests in a piece of civilization which will be used by people in productive ways and consuming ways
there is the disconnected operator, who will operate civilization but is not accountable to a lot of society for some reason. this could be a matter of money and privilege like the traditional definitions of "bourgeoisie"/"petty bourgeoisie" or simply existing in a place that's a little too self-contained
there is the connected operator, who operates civilization but is forced to be accountable to a wide group of people. these people work at huge businesses like Twitter, sometimes in government

it's like it's not the means of production, the productive business, that matters any more
now the major conflict is over whether you're going to be accountable to other people as you do your work, or you're going to force others to take whatever you give them or go somewhere else
almost all of us are separated from the productive business, but we still don't trust each other and still revert to isolated circuits of civilization competing with each other for who can exert control over who to make who "listen" and "cooperate" - but neither wants to be degraded and forced into that kind of hierarchy so they continue their standoff

if co-ops become Disconnected Operators, they will never change anything, because there is no mechanism where they can become united and cooperate to stop anything
similarly if anarchists become Disconnected Operators of small-scale communities, this cannot lead to a democratic society where large projects get done or people dismantle large systems like imperialism because there is nothing making them unify and combine their efforts versus do a small effort and then stop.

the disconnected operator has a class interest to not get people united in order to exercise control over their local area of influence, economically and socially
but this is a reactionary interest. although people could strive to become DOs to protect civil rights because they see no other way, nothing mandates that the control they want must be in order to protect good opinions or healthy relationships or anything functional. it is a very attractive option for reactionaries to preserve outdated ideas
