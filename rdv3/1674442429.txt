a shadow trotskyism?


i am so wary of how people have been talking about china
the trotskyists want to say china is doomed because stalinism or something but they definitely think it's time to tear open china and abolish the CPC
this is a continuation of the "tradition" that it was time to tear open the CPSU because it wasn't progressing through fast enough to abolish itself in about a century or perhaps sooner

however, the united states has become really distrustful of china to where the gap between trotskyism and marxism-leninism is kind of closing, not in a good way.
they are both saying the same thing about china, at a really bad time for china when everybody is really smearing china. it's like, if trotsky was doing a bad thing saying all this bad stuff about the CPSU when we were entering the heyday of the orwellians and everybody trying to say marxism was dead, it feels like we're doing the same thing and making some kind of mistake.
it's difficult to describe what the mistake is or what's correct but there's a mistake somewhere
