# "RDism" draft 4
"molecular marxism" / "molecular democracy" - tentative title



the core theme in Marxism is *competition*. Marxism is mainly about ending unnecessary competition so we don't kill each other. 
it is replacing competitive interactions where one group of people gradually eliminates all the other groups with interactions where groups cooperate to solve problems and conflicts, where the plurality of these different groups can actually be preserved.

Liberalism has decided the goal should be endless competition in which everybody fights as hard as possible so that nobody wins and thus eliminates other groups from the contest. this is its method of trying to mediate between countries, political parties, philosophies, identity groups such as LGBT+, and most worringly of all, ethnic groups.
the latest transformation of Liberalism is an attempt to domesticate national liberation movements and anarchist protests so that the struggle between marginalized ethnicities and the surrounding social and political structures never actually has to be resolved - the endless struggle against systemic racism is institutionalized and turned into a strange new kind of systemic racism.



## dots

what is 'quantity into quality' really?
it is the interaction of small things to form larger things and then larger things

emergent behaviors

into the marsh



## is intersectionality *Marxism*??

is the LGBT+black&brown flag "marxism" because it represents smaller things uniting together?
not really.



## property, territory, and empire

empire was a thing that always existed since a long time ago
imperialism was not invented when capitalism started, although you could get that impression reading Lenin's work.

empire already existed because /property/ already existed
the nation-state is a property structure, much like the territories held by a duke or earl back when.
however, a nation-state is an institution for protecting an economy created by one group of people against attack by other groups of people, should they try to destroy it or plunder it

nation-states ultimately developed from small groups of people with a particular culture expanding outward and interacting, perhaps violently, perhaps cooperatively, until there was one big territory containing people with a particular general culture. the culture, ethnicity, or national identity of the people is not the important thing that makes a nation-state exist - the nation-state is an agreement of two groups of people (nation-states) that came into contact that they will each keep a certain national territory instead of fighting each other to change the borders again. this is the basic reason why it can make sense for there to be a national liberation movement to create a new nation-state where people are free from war with some other country, even as other countries start to contemplate at what point in time /their/ nation-state will become obsolete and turn into something else.

This is an incredibly important concept to understand if we would like to defeat the specter of anti-communism.
In Trotskyism, Liberalism, anarchism, and some other ideologies, there is an idea that a workers' state can become oppressive by enforcing core principles and trying to create a unified structure which can defend against attacks by Liberal countries in various forms. the "Stalinists" are not letting us practice Trotskyism or anarchism and they must be doing it because they want to stop progress and keep power, not because they want to keep the country intact in the face of actual threats. "the nation-state" is encroaching on organic community and snatching people into capitalism and Liberalism before we can construct anarchism.

the only way to stop these claimed abuses by "Stalinism" and "the nation-state" is to look ahead to the day when national territories and the material life inside do not have to be protected like business property simply to exist.
however, this ultimately requires ending political and economic competition between countries.

Trotsky once claimed that socialism could not be achieved "in one country" without addressing imperialist countries, but ironically, it takes cooperation with so-called "Stalinist" countries in order to move beyond "socialism in one country". Likewise, if they would like to move out of the "primary stage of socialism" and its requirements to continuously build up more industry to compete with other nation-states, workers' states cannot fear other countries forever.
competition between countries and between Marxist movements in one country and another is a big part of the problem.



## we are not wreckers

are communists wreckers to Liberalism?

the united states is nothing more than one big system of people and industries

don't sabotage the united states, /build/ a better united states



## National "Socialism"

a favorite argument is to point to so-called "National Socialism" or Nazism as supposedly just a variation of Bolshevism

but really, nazism is tied to the property structure of the nation-state and defending this property.
if nazis spout weird expressions like "America is the land of America", this is the real significance - the United States is a piece of property that has to be defended from invaders and "vandals", but nationalists will unite *to keep property going* - and possibly to force everyone on that property into the same nationality as if it were an empire, rather than making room for national liberation movements.
this is part of how "nazbols" were created and ended up so fascinated with imagery of Stalin - they became fascinated with the Great Patriotic War period and the Soviet Union raising a great army to defend its territory against other countries, rather than thinking about why this war was fought and for what principles.

Liberals will act like fascism is easy to avoid, as easy as refusing to learn about Marxism.
but there are really two major options: trying to end national property and the competition to claim it, or trying to keep it going, possibly at the expense of other nations.

you could indefinitely try to tend to your own problems and not solve them at all
the cup is always empty.
