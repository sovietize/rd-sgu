# production cycles


## production

every time you create finished things it is an act of production
sounds redundant at first, but many people don't understand this

many people know that working for a corporation to create Their things is unsatisfactory
but then they try to create things independently, and become independent producers.
this is analogous to the Soviet peasant that doesn't even have a tractor.
however now this person thinks they can simply outcompete the kulak with several employees, say hey come over to my project where we create better things, and achieve socialist production at the local level.

if you do only this the "kulaks" will win.
they are much more efficient at creating Finished Products even if those things are crap
so they simply push out a bunch of crappy things until everybody has one,
and then the independent producer can't market good things or even find an audience. because all the consumers believe that task is complete.
the consumers are the ones who give Production meaning. this is the only 'democratic' element of a market system.
however if the consumers are very stupid they will never demand better products.
in this way capitalists can fully undermine the democracy of markets and make capitalism entirely about power and hierarchy.

in a Liberal society it is then on the independent producer to be impossibly amazing in order to ever persuade consumers they want better products, and be allowed to invent and produce better products.

we see this pattern repeat a lot: somebody has a genuinely better idea, it fails to be completed or catch on or "come back", people wonder why, crappier things that still have a stream of money behind them prevail. because Production has been reduced to "Bourgeois Production", where all production is begun by the bourgeoisie and the primary purpose of any Product anyone in society experiences as a Finished Product is to grow capital for the bourgeoisie.
really, it's no longer enough to call it "capitalist production". that suggests there's some kind of equal opportunity for regular people to get into a corporation and have a say in what to produce next.
it's better to call it "Bourgeois Production" to highlight that no, in late-stage capitalism we really are at the stage of the bourgeoisie /planning consumers/ and deciding what consumers get to buy. all production and innovation and 'visions for the future of industries' have been gradually reduced to bourgeois property Belonging to small groups of people.


## gamification

as capitalism goes on, more parts of life begin to outright resemble capitalism.

people have tried to point out the phenomenon with words like "gamification",
but have neglected that when we design games based around scoring systems in a capitalist society, we often bake general concepts in our capitalist society into our games.
- think about how many games are accidentally or intentionally based around the concepts of war or feudalism. 
  - we have world map strategy games like _Risk_, games where you accumulate an army and conduct a war against other states like _Magic: the Gathering_, feudalism simulators modelling small-scale wars between nobility like _Gemfire_ and _Fire Emblem_, MMOs and other RPGs with concepts like "raids" and "campaigns", literal military campaign simulators with guns and soldiers and military jets
- on the flip side there are computer games like _Animal Crossing_ and _Stardew Valley_ which try to be nonviolent, but then there are capitalists and bank accounts involved in concepts of progression in the game
- one of the most overlooked manifestations of capitalism is _Pokémon_.
  - particularly in _Pokémon Go_ you basically accumulate employees (thousands!) which gradually earn money and resources so you can invest in more means of production, but the employees have no say in what you do or whether you "fire" them. there is no such thing as pokémon simply existing in the world and leading their own lives if you aren't using them. they can only be hoarded by trainers doing nothing or not meaningfully exist
  - in this light it's really interesting that even _Digimon World_ tries to portray a world where Digimon can simply exist in a city without being owned or used as your employees.

thus, people have mischaracterised what "social media" platforms actually are, namely ones built around a churning river of "news headlines" like Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit.
this design forces competition into the system silently such that people don't notice.
- the platform creates a cycle of Production where people create content and post it for others, and adds market mechanics so that some people move upward and some move down or stagnate.
  - sometimes it's not even necessary to deliberately create incentives. sometimes the natural preference of viewers for one kind of content over another will create competition as creators are pushed to produce that kind of content to get any views
  - a mere chronological news feed can force people to compete to be the most recent or most regular poster just to be seen.
- on YouTube, creators are widely aware that "The Algorithm" completely turns the platform into a market, and in fact a kind of "capitalist planned economy" where planning is further tuning The Algorithm.
  - technically the advertisers are "buying" the Products to market to the viewers, vaguely like retail stores buy products to sell for their own revenue.
- perversely, people will feel like it's /more/ meaningful to post their content into a social media Market because as a kind of Production, it gives them an audience, which gives the content a clear purpose in society. assuming the post gets seen.
  - this is one of the reasons why there are now "only 5 websites", besides the phenomemon of various privately-owned web hosts and platforms of the past going out of business in the normal process of capitalism, and all the remaining businesses consolidating into just a few.

thus "social media" news rivers actually capture social interaction and convert it into Bourgeois Production, 
where quantity will always be more important than quality or utility because with its insistence on Finished Products and unit prices Bourgeois Production always rewards having more units to sell over having any good Products.

people have tried to say that "the 24-hour news cycle" somehow led to Twitter and "Twitter addiction",
but the "24-hour news cycle" is a Bourgeois Production cycle where a Finished Product is sold each day to advertisers for revenue. insurance companies, "Big Pharma", Mike Pillow.
- many people even know this, but they don't connect it with the reason "social media" news rivers exist.
- news rivers like Twitter exist to encourage regular people to engage in Bourgeois Production while believing they aren't working for capitalists because workers are supposed to steadily earn money, right? they aren't supposed to just be gambling at an uncertain chance for fame and glory and customers?

the ultimate result of this whole system, Bourgeois Production and competitive news rivers, is to gradually sell everyone the idea that there are no proletarians, only bourgeoisie, and that it's /natural/ for every individual to upgrade into a (bigger) bourgeois. [-> "overlapping bourgeoisie and proletariat"]
everyone thinks, well i have to fight my way to the top of the feed / Algorithm, and it's very hard to get there without things like investments or employees or spending money to make the product more impressive. so maybe that's an okay thing to do.


## labour movements

the capitalist block on innovation shifts the whole organising discussion to only talking about working conditions and harms of capitalism, because people won't conceptualise the /benefits of socialism/.
it's thought people can only understand harms and downsides of not ending capitalism.
but this may be an error.

many times the people of the United States cannot even conceptualise harms of capitalism.
they will think things like:
- capitalist Jobs are fundamentally an okay concept
- "while we have capitalism we need Elon Musk" - no pointing out particular capitalists as examples of why capitalists are bad
- governments can address global climate change without even abolishing oil companies and oil tycoons
  - Kurzgesagt's video on this is a doozy. they try to convince us capitalists will produce all the green technologies.
  - worse, their centre-Liberal video sounds no different from PragerU's oil boss video where they say the solution is "investing in green technologies to lower their cost".
- everything is okay if /they/ have a good Job and all they need to do is prevent fascism and not actually challenge capitalism to benefit other workers. the non-solidarity Liberal that thinks every kind of suffering is individual and all of it can be described in terms of improving individual lives.
- "tankies" are the worst (these at times include both Identitarian fascists and Marxist-Leninists), however capitalism is bad and we need "Socialism", however 98% of the individual pieces of capitalism are okay and it's unclear what actually needs to change

one of the weird artefacts of this is an "institutionalising" of identity politics.
- people understand there is racism, and even call it "systemic racism", but attempt to carve arbitrary exceptions out of Liberalism so it isn't as racist. one day people declare that stealing and rioting is never ever okay even for black people.... then it changes the precise day that a bunch of people have a movement that's impossible to ignore, when an exception must be made and everyone must uphold the exception so Liberalism puts on a good face and doesn't look evil. it's evil to /make Liberalism look evil/, when people commit crimes against the Liberal state, or when they attack the exceptions in Liberalism.
- it becomes "just the way things are done" that people experiencing some particular oppression rise up as an identity group just to get any recognition of their grievance at all, rather than being able to be part of some greater movement.
  - identity politics and the resistance to identity politics form a closed loop together. you have an identity politics movement, then everybody saying identity politics is bad from conservatives to leftists to occasionally centre-Liberals, but then this solidifies that identity politics movements /have to keep happening/ because they haven't successfully gotten their issues accepted into 'regular' movements yet.
  - intersectionality is the solution to this but we won't do it.
- a certain non-solidarity develops again because it's like, you /are/ worthy of the anti-misogyny group, anti-racism group, etc. or you /aren't/. and sometimes different movements argue about whether they're helpful or harmful to each other's aims rather than working together.
