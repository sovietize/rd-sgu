# who are The Left?


## who are we organising for what?

the biggest blind spot in communist strategies in the United States (and possibly other First-World countries?) is not foreseeing the possibility of /other/ left-wing ideologies winning the struggle to lead "The Left".

there are understandable reasons for this:
- many Marxists don't fully know about other ideologies or know, for instance, that Žižek is actually a Lacanian and it's a totally different model
- each major group of ideologies tends to silo itself such that Marxists talk to various kinds of Marxists, anti-racist academics talk to each other, and Lacanians interact with Lacanians and things that would serve their kind of model
- even when you look into the others, Marxism is one of the most Material and "correct" models, so how could something less empirical and comprehensive win instead of them?

it's very appealing to think all we need to do to win is have a materially correct model of the world and act in accordance with it, and simply get everybody to the correct understanding.
but in an era of virtualisation and Nests and "preferring the social" and the Relationship Market,
it's unclear whether we are actually allowed to operate on reality or whether there is another special set of rules for successfully organising people. it could be the case that while Marxism is correct, we need to use a completely different ideology to be able to "unglue" people and get them to act on its conclusions

alternatively, maybe we /are/ allowed to operate in reality but implementing interfactionalism requires "playing every side of the table".
if we want to organise as many people as possible, do we all have to learn about a bunch of different ideologies and teach everyone about ten completely different ideologies just to get a "bite on the line"?
- "hello, this is the Left Coalition, here is our info card with the top twenty distinct left-wing ideologies, do any of them appeal to you"
- personally, I actually wouldn't mind this. if there was any significant hope of the "top 20" gradually merging into each other and cooperating more as people from one ideology recruit people to the others, I think it would be fully worth learning about and even campaigning for other ideologies.
- in a way this would be kind of analogous to when a megacorporation buys up 50 competing brands and profits off all of them. we offer you a ton of different ideologies to choose from but they're not competing any more.

in any case, I think we all need to be /aware/ of the contest between the 20 or so new left-wing ideologies.
we don't necessarily need to solve it immediately or instantly.
but we do need to be highly aware of the fact that each one could have a totally, utterly different vision of what "The Left" is supposed to do if it wins. this could be a benign difference, or it could pose serious problems in getting people organised because people won't actually align onto the same goals and tasks and may not even have the same model of reality or what's important.

the first task may be to focus on aligning everybody purely onto /Materialism/ and the /spiral dialectic/ so that they have an interest in working together, finding a shared goal, and reconciling their differences.



## "coalition info card"

"Liberalism is going DOWN!
the United States has crumbled into one big shouting match where there is no correct answer to any material problem except which team shouts the loudest.
it's clear we cannot keep the republic if we rely on this system forever.
with tens of new ideologies attempting to take the place of centre-Liberalism, which ones will get to form the /new/ republic?"


### Marxism-Leninism / "Stalinism"

- everyone should understand the problems with capitalism, Liberalism, and static/Cyclic thinking when trying to solve material problems
- the masses should form a labour movement
- parties should try to form that agree on the best understanding of material reality and current issues, but ultimately they should only consider themselves important and relevant if the labour movement is growing and gaining ground. at that point a centralised communist leadership can form
  - one problem is in here. the United States has a lot of trouble getting workers to /organise/ or /resist/ at all without outright teaching them elements of Marxism
- the larger movement will attempt to unify labour organisations /against/ capitalism and toward ideas of a workers' state that can regulate businesses and obsolete capitalists
  - if people are sufficiently unified against capitalism, you will receive the /consent/ of the people to displace Liberal apparatuses and create a workers' state. Marxism does not "attack first"
- there will likely be a period of "state capitalism", where corporations are converted into state-owned enterprises and then into whatever comes after corporations
  - importantly, you must /transition/ everything already there from the worse state it's currently in to what will come next. structures, classes, various existing problems, everything.
  - if the transition is proceeding well, you hopefully end up with full employment and fair wages — the era of socialism, where everybody is paid a 'reasonable amount' per amount of work rather than a fraction of revenue
  - problem two: no country has fully found a solution for getting through the transition period. China for one has been stuck at corporations for a while
- if more than one country is well organised, attempt to rebuild the Communist International


### Trotskyism

- the masses should form a labour movement with communists providing guidance and helping to organise them
- it may be very important to literally form American soviets if you go by what Trotsky said
- the people will attempt to run the entire economy through economic democracy and/or planning and capitalism will simply /stop/ a short way into the transition and not restart. if you recreate capitalists you have a "degenerated workers' state", i.e. you have stepped backward
- you have to get rid of capitalists and also bureaucrats, and attempt to weave together the masses who will take power away from both of them somehow. I think.
  - ...but this interacts in confusing ways with the fact real Trotskyist parties often need privileged 'bureaucrats' to run their parties
- if there is somehow any country that would really want to sabotage and prevent a communist United States you also have to flip over that one


### anarchism

[unfinished section]


### Lacanianism

- society and revolution are both considered to take place within people's minds so any large social change must /change people's minds/
  - we aren't allowed to use dialectics /because/ minds always rewrite history into a current working model of knowledge.
  - basically we are only allowed to consider current states of any system and not past states
- we have to somehow collapse wrong towers of assumptions underlying behaviour and society (Signifiers) by refusing to go along with them, and get individuals to change their minds that way. each individual is seen as a bridge between "mind" and the external world, /therefore/ we have to make progress on social ideas individual by individual
  - some Lacanians actually do believe in ending capitalism, so this process would then apply to organising individuals against capitalism
- Lacanians appear to be stuck in notions a lot like Liberal democracy where you cannot keep society stable and it will always be in tension, but these individual actions on individuals can relieve the tension as it appears I guess
- it's unclear if Lacanians have a /particular/ most common vision of postcapitalism or "post- Liberal democracy"

### syndicalism

- the important thing is to get more people into the labour movement whether any of them actually cooperate with each other. we have to get "The White Working Class" and suburban parents into the movement just to have a lot of people
  - US syndicalism has a nasty red-brown problem where it so naïvely goes for as many people as possible it will throw away minority rights yesterday just to promise suburban parents something that might not be feasible in a bourgeois political system and might be an empty promise
- we have to put "bread and butter issues" on the ballot like schools and then more people will vote for the right party again. definitely the problem with conservatives is they're not being listened to and if we just listened to them even they might flip over
- protesting about things other than unions is not allowed, because how can we heal the divide if we don't choose universal issues experienced by all individual humans!!
- everyone who's anti-government and against corporations is automatically an ally. it doesn't matter if people have materially wrong ideas like protesting vaccines and masks /if/ they are demanding rights from corporations
  - here you see communism/Menshevism, anarchism, anarcho-capitalism, /and/ miscellaneous conspiracy theorists all lumped together.
  - this got really bad when Richard Wolff was supporting the white supremacist protests in Canada because they were ostensibly 'workers' and against the government. US syndicalists will literally just go recruit nazis to get greater numbers
- syndicalist models of ending capitalism will inevitably be really slow. many of them seem to only talk about building up a generic labour movement, while Wolff thinks you should progressively put all the workers into cooperatives and this will eventually /cause/ a workers' state basically because co-ops replace big businesses and big business lobbying falls away
- (I have to be real, I think this is one of the most accidentally-fascist "left-wing" ideologies in the United States. I can't stand it personally.)
