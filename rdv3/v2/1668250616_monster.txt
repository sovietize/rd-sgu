alienation between industry blob and art-creating fans of art


## monster empires **

[I really don't know if this belongs in this outline or as its own independent video / article thingy. but here goes]

here's a case study in Bourgeois Production which is "near and dear" to me:
Ultraman Series (Ultra Series), and its descendant series Digimon, Monster Farm (Monster Rancher), Telefang, Pokémon and people's many unknowing clones specifically-of-Pokémon, etc.
All of these kicked off with Ultra Series, and arguably with Godzilla series before it, but Ultra Series was notable for creating an episodic "monster of the day" TV show format with lots of commercial breaks that would both sell a lot of products and prove simple for other series to copy, very quickly leading to a new genre of "ultra-series-likes".
- example: the first Pokémon show and the first Digimon show /exactly/ followed this template of each plot broadly being about fighting or encountering some specific monster.
- people don't quickly realise Pokémon's origins because the "monsters" are much simpler and 'cuter' than in _Ultraman_ 1966 or _Ultra Q_, but it is very much structured like a scifi serial show with less 'edge' and more mundane happenings

today, I learned about a game releasing called "Ultra Kaiju Monster Rancher"... and I had incredibly mixed feelings.
in principle this was a neat idea, finally connecting another monster series with its roots. but there were also a bunch of unsettling implications.

- industry is just one big blob now. individual corporations are no longer "the point", there is just one big Capitalism that either finds something to do with you or discards you
  - a lot of people's talk about videogames in general is simply about what bigger company bought out what company. for a bit there were videos about how Spyro got bought by Activision, then there were videos about how Activision and Spyro got bought by Microsoft
  - the previous time I had this same thought, it was about Digimon step counter watches which also had Ultra Series characters.
    - the connecting thread was Bandai, one gigantic company that's basically responsible for all the TV commercials on various monster series. even if one company didn't own all of them, in practice it was funding them and promoting them.
  - I could see a future where "every" monster series crosses over with Ultra Series and/or becomes owned by the same people as Tsupro or Bandai.

- there is no longer any such thing as making a media series because you don't like another series. everything is considered complementary to everything else, and you see it especially in these deals where things cross over but ultimately the purpose is to strengthen the Single Industry Blob while making sure neither company has to change
  - 'Kaiju Rancher' has good things about it, but also feels like some kind of evidence that porting Monster Rancher 1/2 was merely a cash grab and these two titles are at best raising money for future Products

- the idea of independent media creators is an illusion we keep around to justify capitalism.
  - independent creators on Steam etc may release one or two things but don't necessarily get to have a consistent Job, as basically all creator Jobs that become consistent get swallowed up into the Single Industry Blob.
  - many "independent" Steam games will hardly get looked at. meanwhile 'Kaiju Rancher' will explode onto newsfeeds even though many people haven't heard of Ultra Series. if it's corporate videogame that was marketed, they Buy and Post About

-

- it should never be forgotten that Ultra Series was created by communists to sneak vaguely anti-war, anti-imperialist, utopian-socialist themes onto TV. but at this point it is not empowering labour movements in any way
  - you cannot be empowered by working with or making deals with Ultra Series / Bandai. the Single Industry Blob can only use you, bend you entirely to its purposes to deserve a paycheck, and discard you. if it even lets you in.
  - let's also not forget the times Ultra Series shows had fascism in them with _Geed_ and _Taiga_. _Taiga_ had plots that read like you took Fox News opinions and replaced immigrants with aliens

- if Richard Wolff got his wish of building the fractal Mondragon corporation we might see it turn into the Single Industry Blob all over again and treat people as mere tools all over again because it's always going to be the Single Industry Blob and what it's decided to produce versus what the workers need




we now "socialise" through markets
a Product releases, then a bunch of people buy it, then it floods across social media Markets
a company decides what culture and interests we will have and sells them to us and then they flow downstream into a million social media posts, and this is seemingly the top way any idea is spread through society now. corporations sell it to people and people buy it! then they talk to each other about what they Bought.
- and this is literally how we meet people. most interests we meet people through are tied into this phenomenon of exploding across Twitter or YouTube briefly and then disappearing and then another thing exploding.
- Bourgeois Production and the people who run it /decide what will be on Twitter/, they /decide what we'll be talking about/.

proletarians experience the anarchy of production and corporations experience the hierarchical empire of production
it's like.... we've got a United States of industry which has joined together and abuses everyone else until they become its tools and then get to exist


to be fair this is not unique to the modern era; some elite group of rulers and aristocrats producing culture and deciding what culture would be certainly existed in previous forms of class society.
however, this is the modern form. corporations decide what culture will be based on what they can Market, people accept the idea of working at whatever arbitrary Job capitalism allows them and Buying whatever culture is churned out by the Industry Blob or independent efforts at proprietary culture, then people pretend to be guilty about supporting corporate pop culture, and complain about how bad it is, but up to now have not widely united to build up and elaborate on ideas such as User Democracy to genuinely end this phenomenon of culture being a commodity and one which average people are only allowed to Buy and not to produce.




## workers demand corporations making workers work harder!! **

yeah, that's satirical.

why aren't workers resisting capitalism?
watch youtube to learn what workers want... and you'll find it's mildly depressing
workers want to uncritically accept capitalism and then chew out corporations in reviews and tell corporate management to wield workers better

I've seen the complaint on Pokémon twice:
game freak needs to outsource its overworld to xenoblade team   [*nh]

- corporations need to deliver better products
- corporations need to Blob Up more and outsource parts of their task to other studios

people talk about blobbing up studios more than they talk about labour movements for actual workers
they think a "better work culture" can only be created by better corporate decisions   [*nh]


how can we make fun of the Soviet Union any more when one of the top legitimate complaints is people were given too high of standards to meet. Stalin's government says you have to produce so much and it's Evil, corporations say you have to produce so much and there's absolutely nothing we can do about 80 hour work weeks.
