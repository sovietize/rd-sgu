## material incentives / "Ideological States of Apparatuses"

I used to be very confused about what was keeping people so incredibly attached to every shred of the capitalist system and unwilling to accept basically any kind of innovation, much less shreds of a new ideology

then I realised there were basically always material incentives. [-> "overlapping bourgeoisie and proletariat"]

- some people get satisfied with their capitalist Job and feel not obligated to help anybody else as much as spread bourgeois attitude and "wish everyone good luck in the capitalist competition". the microbourgeoisie
- if you're talking to Literally the Bourgeoisie, they will look for every exception to capitalism harming workers and/or owners and act like if one worker and one owner are happy the whole system works
- some people who are out of work cannot think in a properly systemic way because they are too focused on their own survival — although it may also be they can afford not to work, and this is acting as a material incentive to put off creating successful organising strategies. the lumpenbourgeoisie
  - meanwhile, capitalist employers make it hard to get through the interview process and into a Job, making it harder for lumpenbourgeoisie/lumpenproletarians to enter the workforce at all, much less have an organised workplace.
  - many anarchists believe refusing all capitalist Jobs has an effect, but this /may/ simply be feeding the phenomenon of the lumpenbourgeoisie, who are materially incentivised to aim to be petty-/microbourgeoisie when it appears harder to try to get employed and become a proletarian
- for genuine proletarians, capitalist products can be a material incentive. if I go to work at capitalist Job I can go buy capitalist product
  - proprietary video games are my go-to example. repeatedly releasing discrete Products every few years that are unnecessarily expensive but declared Finished Products before they're really satisfactory is a great way to materially incentivise people to put off trying to abolish capitalism. 'but I first have to save up money to buy exclusive proprietary game! abolish capitalists? maybe another day'
- some large YouTube creators such as Vaush or ContraPoints get paid a bunch by miscellaneous fans for exactly their current views, and then feel no obligation to read more and get a better ideology.
  - these are petty bourgeoisie who don't realise they exist in a competitive environment where they can Grow Their Business, thereby launching them from 'proletarians for hire' (whose income prospects would be fairly steady) up to petty bourgeoisie
  - 'proletarians for hire' vs petty bourgeoisie really illustrates the idea capitalism is "a tumour" where businesses grow in an unchecked way at inappropriate times.
- social links can be a material incentive. if you have nothing else to materially "buy you off", you may still have an enclosed social network of people who will continuously reassure you everything is fine — whether those people are conservatives or centre-Liberals talking about civil rights people "just deserve".
  - the more self-contained your social network is and unlikely it is to expand or meet others, the less likely you'll ever run into actual proletarians or class-conscious Anybody, and the more likely you'll only ever be talking to various kinds of bourgeoisie.
  - the more your social network continuously 'rewards' you for not truly changing and for maintaining your current social group over trying to challenge any of its views or make any of its people better people or leave it, the more you may become confused about whether any other ideologies are viable.
  - this one is unintuitive, but think of the fact that psychotherapy, Twitter corporation, and church donations all have a monetary value. the material benefits of false emotional reassurance are reflected in the value of e.g. Twitter corporation, and churches getting money whether they have actually helped people or not. these are like the price society forks over for the product of false emotional reassurance

Althusser writes about "ideological state apparatuses"/"interpellation", which are something like, arrangements of people and relationships which reproduce capitalism. somebody in the ISA basically receives bourgeois attitudes and strategies particular to that ISA and passes them on to other people inside/outside the ISA

I think this concept is a great description of many processes in the United States, although it may not be quite complete.
- Althusser's ISAs seemed to me to focus a bit too much on arrangements and structures, while I think the idea of material incentives is a lot more explanatory because it explains why people may or may not choose to break out of them
- on YouTube, people have described "a Human Centipede of clout" where a big creator with a wrong view is socially linked to several small creators and they all then perpetuate the wrong view in the process of perpetuating each other's channels by boosting each other's streams and opinions. you could say the "Human Centipede" is simply an ISA that 'digests' wrong views across its structure, or that a bunch of petty-/microbourgeoisie have formed an informal guild which offers a material incentive of revenue/engagement for holding it together at all costs.
  - either way, there never /has/ to be a "CIA plant" to create a structure where everybody is spreading around "US State Department talking points". a competitive system of petty-/microbourgeoisie and a bunch of fans with money can easily lead to the exact same thing.

I stumbled onto ideas resembling interpellation first, and only after thinking more about what was 'powering' this and keeping it going did I finally reach the idea of Additional Bourgeois Classes.
- for a little while I tried to conceptualise material incentives as YouTube "regressing back to pre-capitalism where the lowest class is independent producers". but I don't think that's as explanatory as there simply being bourgeois "workers" we confuse for proletarians.



## overlapping bourgeoisie and proletariat

in "First World" countries like the United States, the bourgeois relation and proletarian relation are separate phenomena
the bourgeois relation is from investor to investment/"property" to someone else's labour
but the proletarian relation is from employee to employer and investments
thus somebody can have /both/ a proletarian and bourgeois relation, existing in an overlap between classes.
ex.: an employee who claims to live off their Job, but is comfortably insulated by family members' businesses, or holds stocks as a retirement plan. does a proletarian in India get to retire on stocks??

in many countries this distinction has not actually mattered;
it was sufficient to identify people with a bourgeois relation and label them "the bourgeoisie" and everybody else the proletariat, and tell people to join the proletarian faction and disempower and abolish the bourgeoisie.
but in the United States the process of "becoming class-conscious" is different because people must become conscious that /they are exploiters/ and /they are not yet proletarians/.
the so-called "workers" of the United States are often not. they often have some kind of "investment" that grows or continually produces. and they must become conscious that the whole concept of investments is bad and they will have to give it up /as a concept/ and remake society into one where investments are not held individually nor by 'individual' industrial organisations greedily trying to control everything outside them (corporations, co-ops, guilds, cartels, etc).


new table of classes:

big bourgeoisie   - big businesses, capitalists proper, owners of giant business platforms for big/small bourgeoisie
petty bourgeoisie - small businesses, independent producers who hold their career like an investment
lumpenbourgeoisie - people out of work whose "investments" are still producing
microbourgeoisie  - employed workers who have the option of work or trying to grow some "investment"
proletariat       - workers who have no option but to be employees
lumpenproletariat - people out of work with basically nothing

lumpenbourgeoisie
there are two kinds of lumpens. one is proletarian and one is bourgeois
both have been excluded from "The Economy" i.e. Capitalism Proper
but the lumpenbourgeois is incentivised to pick up conservatism or centre-Liberalism to defend the teeny tiny investment they exist on, living off somebody else's living off somebody's labour.
lumpenbourgeoisie may include social-democrats depending on social programs that in turn exploit other countries. the key characteristic is that they are unemployed / out of business, and can totally afford not to work at all for at least a few years.

microbourgeoisie
this class somewhat replaces the idea of the labour aristocracy.
a microbourgeois is somebody who has both bourgeois and proletarian streams of income; either a lumpenbourgeois or proletarian can become one by picking up the characteristics of the other.
there is only a small distinction between microbourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie. if a microbourgeois gets to the point of basically having a business or stable investment that overshadows their "day job", they become petty-bourgeois. however, a distinction does exist because there are a lot of First World "workers" who are not quite petty bourgeoisie. if they appear to be proletarians in daily life but are being "bought off" with something that is quite literally an investment, like stocks or "a corporate pension you keep after quitting", they may be microbourgeoisie.
the primary thing that seals somebody as microbourgeoisie and not a mere "proletarian with a washing machine" is a tiny shred of private property with aspiration to grow it. if they genuinely view their individual privilege as totally unrelated to "capitalism" or "the bourgeoisie", thinking of this as mere "chance success that if someone else didn't get, oh well", or they see it as perfectly normal to have two whole complementary economic roles while others are jobless and genuinely have aspirations to grow into petty bourgeoisie, they are solidly microbourgeoisie.
- (edit: as time went on I began to lean toward the idea of this class being called the "labour bourgeoisie" instead of the "microbourgeoisie" as that seemed more intuitive. but that also implies a concept leaning back toward the original "labour aristocracy" idea where some people merely /believe/ they have the characteristics of labour bourgeoisie when materially they should already be proletarians. class consciousness is complicated.)


looking at YouTube as an example:
big bourgeoisie   - owners of YouTube, advertisers
petty bourgeoisie - larger creators on YouTube who get ad revenue or sponsorships
lumpenbourgeoisie - unpaid creators who can afford to make a bunch of videos while unemployed
microbourgeoisie  - people who are comfortably employed but still seeking *more* money on youtube
proletariat       - creators earning all their money at a day job; employees of larger creators; /some/ patron-supported creators
lumpenproletariat - people who can't afford to make unpaid videos but still do

it should be noted that both a person's "day job", if applicable, and any earnings on youtube factor into this class chart. youtube basically opens up the opportunity for anybody to climb up to the next tier of bourgeoisie, or for lumpenproletarians to thrash upward to proletarians / petty bourgeoisie.



## a movement of class traitors

in previous communist movements petty-bourgeois class traitors were marginal in number
this class was mainly represented by people like Lenin, Trotsky, Ché Guevara
- and /arguably/ the Soviet government after it was established. all these writings about a "New Class" or "the PMC" are unnecessary when you can see that the Bolsheviks admitted that "society still has to work through its remaining contradictions". if they were in some kind of bourgeois position before, they can reject their privilege and try to improve one shared set of working conditions, but the notion of "petty-bourgeois academics sitting back and writing theories" doesn't go away until the society advances further.

in contrast, a successfully 'awakened' United States would have *many* of these theorist types.
there would be a bunch of genuine proletarians who can only think about the most nuts-and-bolts issues, but then there would be a bunch of privileged class traitors who spout off various hypotheses and ideas.

thus the problem of "defeating Trotskyism" cannot be ignored.
if the United States is basically going to be full of a bunch of Trotsky — i.e., bourgeois class traitors — a bunch of really confused revisionist movements made of privileged people and each trying to come up with bright ideas is about what we would expect.
but it takes many more forms than Trotskyism. there's Lacanianism, postcolonial theories that are against all racism but hate Marxism-Leninism, and any number of things.
- which much like the internal sects of Trotskyism can all get into fights with each other. in this sense the "superstructural" shape of Trotskyism is repeated across many movements of bourgeois theorists who vaguely want to break free from Liberal capitalism or its imagined "one or two flaws and no more".

ironically Trotsky is much more useful than we think, solely because of all the things that happened before and in reaction to him rather than anything he actually said.
he is a very interesting example of a privileged person who had some very bourgeois understandings of things in the beginning eventually becoming an ardent supporter of Bolshevism who also basically never dropped out of it.
- the fact it was his own wrong version aside, you can't say the same for a lot of later "Trotskyists".
so in only this one very specific moment in his life, he actually sets quite a good example for Americans.
we should study what kinds of things create class traitors who want to be proletarians and don't keep clinging to bourgeois privilege and attitudes while attempting to create left-wing theories.


## incentives to be Trotsky

what makes somebody behave like Trotsky, spreading around incorrect ideas and trying to build up internal factions, and not like Ché Guevara, contributing in a more selfless way to the communist movement?

arguably this is a kind of bourgeois attitude tied to competition between movements.
- Trotsky tried his best to "be a proletarian productively contributing to society", but he always did it in ways like founding some periodical which proceeded to be specifically his. _Borba_, his newspaper thing in Mexico, etc.
  - in this way he is similar to YouTube channels that confuse petty-/microbourgeoisie with proletarians and act like by running their own little 'outlet' they are necessarily able to contribute to a collective movement.
  - it should be no wonder that Trotskyist groups are "so good at" establishing social media pages. they do not understand that this is a competitive environment and they may not really be building up anything but their own specific group against everything else.
- "Trotskyism" in Lenin's time and the Fourth International can be understood as a process of competitively building an ideology, where so-called "workers" aspire to Grow their movement into a bigger more successful one, as their particular vision of "having a successful movement".
- even in the modern day, Trotskyist parties /compete/ against each other to be the most successful one, whether they are aware of this or not. as do all the left-wing ideologies that reject Marxism and try to start with racism or the human mind, etc.

in Trotsky's anecdotes about the early formation of the Bolshevik party, he describes visiting a bunch of rather bourgeois places and people — although he and Lenin generally can't stand them and basically see these settings as a thing of the past. [*vi]
- they're trying to build up a workers' movement and they are like, going to operas and visiting the bourgeoisie? not to say either thing is Evil and you can't do it, but it highlights that they are not proletarians and simply bourgeoisie who disliked their privilege and attempted to give it up.

a long time after this, Trotsky goes on repeatedly about "the bureaucracy", and how the Soviet government is paid too much, and "creating state capitalism", and various things.
this fascinated me because it seemed like he was always solidly halfway to a real insight.
- I felt like if he had really thought through anything he said, he would realise all of it applied to him. "Trotsky, you /are/ the bureaucracy!"
  - if the Soviet communist party was "the bureaucracy" for being some kind of insulated organisation too separate from industry and proletarians and for deciding things he didn't like that are then enforced... he should question if a Trotskyist party with the same structure is a good idea.
  - if he does not like "the bureaucracy", he should try harder to actually proletarianise his party and erode the distinction between the masses and the party.
  - but this means him. he has to be willing to raise up average people to potentially take his place, rather than act like he's the only one who could ever do what he does.
- the most frustrating thing about Trotsky's ideas is if he'd simply throw away "degenerated workers' states" then he could try to fix and abolish the bureaucracy. the way things were was easily a potential step to what he wanted.
- (to be fair, if it were really true that Stalin quietly formed a faction of evil Tsarist bureaucrats that all worked to eliminate everyone who was against them, it would inherently make it harder to transition to a proletarian movement because the petty-bourgeois party members are acting in a hierarchical way and won't cede ground in the way required to level out the movement.)
  - (but then we have to question how true it is.)

the "CWI split" provides further evidence that Trotskyism in general may be a failure to proletarianise.   [*cwi]
- in 2019, the Committee for a Workers' International (CWI) got into an argument between its International Secretariat (IS) and central committee (IEC), where the IEC separated and became International Socialist Alternative
- in brief, it was like a Trotskyist group split in two and each shard called the other one "the bureaucracy", like that screenshot of two Spidermen pointing at each other.
- what if /both shards were correct/? what if both of them were the bureaucracy by sheer definition of what a Trotskyist party /is/ and who it's composed of?

the ultimate implication of "squaring Trotskyism" is:
- Marxism-Leninism involves a process of demoting All bourgeoisie including the Additional Bourgeoisie down to proletarians, and the Communist Party has a purpose of collecting and demoting bourgeois theorists while improving conditions for proletarians. 
  - Stalin's government did at least partially know this, although it's unclear if this knowledge was kept in other workers' states like China and North Korea.
- an anarchist transition must accomplish the task of demoting All the bourgeoisie to a proletarian role while /never/ forming a "bureaucratic" party. the precise meaning of how this is done (form an organisation that's not bureaucratic?) will be left undefined.


## proletarians as employees

proletarians /are/ near-synonymous with employees
- this is a slight oversimplification, keeping in mind some cases where China has built some kind of farming cooperative which is organised at the local level and does not operate precisely like it has employees, etc. the idea of "collective farms" had failed multiple times before finally being replaced with this
- however, this simplified model is good for de-programming Americans... United States, Canada, /and/ Mexico, maybe Brazil

to many people in the United States "trying to be an employee" is a totally foreign concept.
we're all taught to try to be the owner or an independent shop
but that model is the hallmark of being the bourgeoisie. [-> "overlapping bourgeoisie and proletariat"]
the "temporarily embarassed millionaire" IS the bourgeoisie. even the "temporarily embarrassed petty-bourgeois" already IS the bourgeoisie.

for some reason I think of a moment from _Ultraman R/B_,
where Ultraman Rosso is comtemplating what he will do with his life in the future
- he says something like "try to be an employee at some company???" with this visual dramatisation of how dumb office jobs are. which is immediately funny to the people of the United States or Japan because, we all know being an employee /sucks/ and being some kind of unique special hero that created their own job is better.
- but I would argue this scene is something of a "bourgeois error" depicted in the show.
  - in the Ultra Series lore, Ultra Warriors are intended to be the "Red Army" of a communist planet that doesn't believe in capitalism and protects people from evil space alien empires.
  - however this scene depicts an Ultra Warrior simply deciding that being an employee is stupid and it's not even worthwhile to go into a regular job to help the regular workers there. it's better to focus on his own advancement and actualisation because the only way for him to have a better life is for /him/ to become greater, and /then/ he can help others.
- amusingly enough _Ultraman Geed_ may have done this a little better with Ultraman Zero actually being alongside Leito at his boring office job.
  - though I think there's an even more subtle error there because is Leito in fact average or privileged? he has a shitty life, but he seems like he may still believe in "climbing the corporate ladder" and becoming the boss as the only option, which would unfortunately land him in the microbourgeoisie
[I don't know how relevant this really is but I just had to write it down somewhere. maybe chop out to some other post later]

if you've proletarianised, you want to be nothing more than an employee, or more precisely, the things an employee /is/.
you want to simply /have/ a job and exist within a consistent organisation within society that won't close tomorrow. you will value a stable job for everybody above "advancing" or "growth".
you will willingly operate at the same rank as regular people, and use the same things they use instead of your own special shiny things just for your own rank (or at the very least use both), as a matter of making sure everybody's working and living conditions actually improve across the board.
you will attempt to organise everybody together for creating a stable society with less "gambling", instability, and crashes.
if that seems crazy or unheard-of, then your task in organising people is to get them to understand this is the problem the movement is trying to address and they have to /work on solutions to the problem/.

proletarianisation doesn't mean you aren't allowed to have ambitions of what you would like to build or contribute to society, and imagine you want to build something greater than you have right now.
it simply means that you would have those ambitions without advancing "above" other people and tying it to your role in the social hierarchy.
it means that instead of progressing to greater levels of ownership over more stuff you would simply stay an "employee" and become the world's most accomplished "employee".
it means that you could invent and achieve all the things you want to, but if we imagine there was an economic democracy to manage formal tiers within organisations, you would separately have to prove that you deserve greater positions in the hierarchy of expertise or management and get elected there.

clearly, some of these characteristics of proletarianisation are not immediately possible while capitalism exists, and you cannot literally try to effect such things today.
but people need to really understand the difference between what they have and what they are aiming for in order to have a successful workers' movement.
in North America, several of the things you already have you may have to /give up/... in exchange for different and arguably better things for everybody including you.
