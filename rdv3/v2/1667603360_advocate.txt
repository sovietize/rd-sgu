## the utility of books

in a sense, if this outline was "fully elaborated" it would simply become my "first book" in philosophy or that existed in my particular ideology
but I think that if you really want to have a successful left-wing movement, producing a book can never be a goal in and of itself, the book can only ever be a side-effect of other things that almost writes itself.

a problem with books: today producing a book is almost the opposite of organising people.
most people don't want books. they want teeny tiny shards of content like ten-minute videos and microblog posts, or simply face-to-face social interactions and social relationships.

- one of the very most critical things to realise about creating change and organising people is that talking at people leads to /nothing/.
  - if you produce a quality long-form book, they might not read it or might not understand it. or they might hit a wall where they ""Disagree"" with the premises of the book (specifically in a very Liberal sense of the word "disagree" where you can decide the truth with your opinions) and toss it away.
  - if you produce a highly informative ten-minute video like people want, they may not find it, or may not be quite sure what to do with it. this /is/ a better way to communicate to masses of people and get them to pass on the idea to others, but one really big problem is even getting the first person to see it and then the first person to acknowledge it or retain the information
  - if you so much as send a couple paragraphs to someone to get them to rethink their strategy on some very specific thing, you may see an "unconscious resistance" where what you say is forgotten or people don't understand the actual significance of it and keep believing exactly what they previously did
    - I'm still sore after the time people were looking around for 'advice' on how to climb up Twitter to get art commissions 'since some popular people had achieved it' and I tried to tell them that in this kind of competitive system almost everyone loses and you should really just get different goals — like maybe building a different system that's more horizontal than newsfeeds, I don't remember what exactly I said
    - this was one of the experiences that led me to posit the microbourgeoisie and that we still need to proletarianise them.
- I love to just pull Trotskyism out of my hat as an example: if some Trotskyist goes somewhere and gives a talk at people about "degenerated workers' states" or some other weird wrong thing, what's that doing to change anything?
  - do you flip over any centre-Liberals by going on and on about Stalin? or would that require a Socratic dialogue with them about what they /currently believe/ and what they demand from Trotskyism in order to support it?
  - (to be fair, I'm not saying you never get anybody that way. that's a real question and not a rhetorical one)

- with this I have come to the conclusion that whenever you create media of any kind, from videos to reference books, you should make them as if possibly nobody will ever see them, and primarily to examine and further your own knowledge.
  - a historical communist writer like Lenin would produce a book so people had a reference manual of how to properly understand reality and organising. so that people knew what to do "on the ground" when faced with workers who don't have time to read a book, not so everyone would literally go read the book.
  - of course, if you make something, you shouldn't so literally assume no audience that you become unaccountable for errors, quality, etc. but you should see everything as an /exercise/ in learning to make better things
  - making media can be a kind of "rubber duck": whether anybody sees them, you will be able to self-reflect and see if you can do a good job communicating something within particular limits or not (time, language register, etc)
- you can make media, but to convince people of anything and change their behaviour you need /deeds/.
  - capitalism is a system of relationships between material things. people, industries, products — connected by jobs, private property (sometimes a complete fiction!), mode of production, plans, etc.
  - it always seems that capitalism would change or break fastest if we were able to work directly with Jobs rather than ideas and simply assert "I have a better job now, you can't put me in bad ones". but this is blocked by the way it requires individuals to form a new system in pieces when the new system can't function within the old system

- it's sometimes said that people have fallen into "preferring entertainment to information", but I don't think that's necessarily a good model.
  - I think it may be instead that people value /social interactions/ over information. a sports game doesn't offer much information but you can share it with others, thus "socially communicating that idea to others", so it gets to keep existing. likewise, a dumb pseudoscientific documentary can be background noise for social activities, so maybe it gets to keep existing too
  - I think that if you're seen as violating the rule that all activities shared with others should be social activities inside a social relationship, people tend to resist. thus if you want to change somebody's mind you are all but required to /talk to them individually/ and /know them as a human being/
  - it is an ongoing relationship over time that changes somebody's mind, not a couple of interactions. even at a large scale, people choose to vote for a particular Liberal party because of their relationship to that party or their relationship with local people who vote for that party

- it may seem like I'm almost getting into theory pleeb's concept of "Functional Illiteracy", but I don't like that model because it presupposes being able to understand long complex books is the natural state of things and capitalism has ruined it, while I think almost the opposite is true: the era of capitalism has persuaded some petty bourgeoisie that everybody should be able to understand long books, and be able to buy them, and have time to read them, because writing books is their career they do for either money or status so therefore it /must/ be a legitimate and respectable activity.
  - this is not to say I think books are universally a bad thing or outdated. I'm only trying to call out this particular attitude in its Entirety with all its connected beliefs and surrounding context.
  - bad joke: Lacanians are guilty of Functional Organising Illiteracy where they don't understand that organising is not about books

all that said, it's a worthy goal for communists to /aim/ for a world where people have more time to research and read and contribute to human knowledge with updated understandings of reality, and we can fill our libraries full of /good, better/ reference books.
but the big thing to realise is we're not there yet. the era of capitalism is a time in which the masses cannot properly value books, and we need to work through it with things other than books so that books can /have/ their proper value.



## "if you or a loved one got mesothelioma..." **

in the United States, there is a whole cultural phenomenon of Mesothelioma Ads.
on network TV, this one ad would play a lot which started with,
"if you or a loved one was diagnosed with mesothelioma from exposure to asbestos..."
and then went on to describe all the terrible unsafe working conditions where you could have been exposed to asbestos and decades later got cancer from basically little asbestos shards puncturing and getting stuck in different body organs. a nasty and horrifying disease   [*msto,*mad]

this mesothelioma ad /alone/ could have been the core of an entire labour movement.
like, this ad should literally be a list of demands that people aren't putting up with any more, and that nobody should think are okay to happen to anybody. and it's likely not the only example of that.

but instead, we have a United States where everyone under 30 would quote the "funny" law firm ad and ask "what's mesothelioma?".
this conceals a great many untold things about the United States:

- people can't see even 30 years into the past and conceptualise what things were like 30 years ago, or approximately the latest time somebody could have first been exposed to asbestos and be diagnosed with mesothelioma today
- nobody /knows/ anybody that can tell about the experiences of 30 years ago and explain why the "funny" mesothelioma ad is so horrifying
  - there are at least two factors here: isolation of people into small enclosed social networks, and pressure on younger people to escape the older generation

- we fundamentally have a culture where we can't prevent things and can only treat them. and we treat things specifically by some private capitalist coming in to make a profit on them. whether this is a pharmaceutical company or a usually-bogus "diet plan" or a psychotherapist or a law firm ad or something else
  - this gets most disturbing when we can only "treat" school shootings. somebody shoots up a school and a bunch of conservatives appeal to mental health treatment while center-Liberals may appeal to gun control
  - we are also terrible at doing the things that will /prevent/ crimes in poor neighbourhoods versus just a bunch of racists saying bad things about them, and putting people in prison
  - impeaching Donald Trump: treatment, not prevention.
- in our heavily bourgeois culture we truly believe that the law firm "does advocacy" or a charity or elected representative in a bourgeois party "does advocacy" and that whatever privileged bourgeois trying to help us treat our problems for their own advancement and gain is genuinely combating the societal problem in question.
  - this is in contrast to like, a movement. a movement of regular people who is not merely building up a CV and rather is doing this most of all to address the problem

- if you act like a problem that happened didn't happen or was no big deal for 30 years.... in everyone's mind the problem will truly go away until the day it blatantly comes back again


if we wonder why we aren't addressing the Long COVID pandemic, well why didn't we address the mesothelioma pandemic. because mesothelioma gets diagnosed decades later. Long COVID gets diagnosed about a year later.
it seems like we've learned that all it takes to make a problem not worth preventing and worth afflicting people with for life is a distance of one year from the initial harm, or perhaps even a few months.

## "wage slavery" is an outdated metaphor

[-> "exit fees": see "nests" entry.]

often in historical communist movements, a concept would come up of "wage slavery".
capitalism would be vaguely compared with ancient empires like the Roman Empire, which would conquer other territories and capture foreign slaves to use as their workers.
- the logic went, although capitalism is not quite as bad as literal slavery, capitalism in each country is like a kind of "empire" which has picked up its citizens and thoughtlessly used them as its tools, so we need to break out of the hold of capitalism and capitalist wage work.
- one example of this metaphor is the Spartacus League in Germany, which was named after the story of a Thracian slave sold as a gladiator who tried to lead a revolt to break other slaves out of the Roman Republic.   [*rL1,*rL2]

but I think there are a bunch of problems with the "wage slavery" metaphor.
- many people falsely feel "freed" by capitalism in a way they wouldn't if they were slaves.
  - the United States very often refers to Capitalist Jobs in terms of "independence" and "freedom" from financially depending on family members or having to put up with their bigoted beliefs
  - you can try to explain to people the concept of solidarity with workers who feel less free, but people often will just not understand and say "but /I/ feel free!" "I'll just redistribute some money to the people who don't and then we don't have to change working conditions or capitalism."
  - here's a choice one I saw the other day: on some Free Software mailing list, a probably-Libertarian had a signature that roughly went, "who freed more slaves, the abolitionist who made noise or the capitalist who created factories?"
- the United States had /real slavery/ for some people and capitalism for others, so it will look really stupid if you try to equivocate these two materially different actually coexisting things
- real slavery still exists in Third-World countries. a few people are just seized as slaves to sell their labour to markets in capitalist countries.
  - thus, United States capitalism could be described as a system where people's privileged position as wage workers is supported by /real actual slavery/ in other places. people are bribed by privilege to not end real slavery, both pre- Civil War and today.
- thinking of capitalism as "wage slavery" is almost a Liberal thing to do, as it suggests everyone is equally a "proletarian" with the same relationship to capital when that's not the way it works.
  - treating everyone as equally the same kind of "wage slave" ignores the very hierarchical nature of capitalism where some people in the world are wage workers, some are literal slaves, some are immigrants trapped in poor-quality jobs and immigration restrictions, some are the lumpenproletariat who should be workers but aren't allowed to be, and some are the "labour bourgeoisie" who are stuck in a bubble of privilege and either don't think about or can't help the other tiers of the system.
  - it should be enough to throw out this metaphor that it's disrespectful to the lumpenproletariat who capitalism forces to not even be useful to society and to /wish/ they were 'wage slaves' while 'wage slaves' in unions and various parties and such have a small amount of power over whether they get to join a labour movement or perhaps a workplace, if only in a very indirect way (workers fall for capitalist bullshit and create a more 'competitive' climate which keeps lumpens out a bit more, etc).

- in the United States, the broad group of people dealing with the ripple effects of southern slavery have ended up resisting communist thought and coming up with various new ideas. this should hint to us there are flaws in communist ideas that need to be remedied, at least small ones.
  - one idea that has gone around in the United States is that there is a "coloniser attitude" which allows privileged racists to have power over people, and you need to "resist the coloniser attitude" to take this power away.
    - one of the more coherent variations of this I've seen is an anarchist idea that society requires us to behave in a certain way and put on a certain "Mask" to interact with it and thus we need to assert our right to have our own identities and personal behaviours so we can reclaim the right to materially survive and have good mental health before we then owe anything to capitalism, etc. in short, racism is a violation of a material right to mental health
    - another variation is that "Whiteness" is the coloniser attitude — white privilege in economic terms is connected with white privilege socially and the negligent attitudes of the White Moderate which feed into systemic racism. thus, people have to reject this negligence and take responsibility for the poor ways others are treated, but not necessarily as a labour movement
      - I always had trouble with this one because I always felt like capitalism stood in the way of really doing this. poor areas like Detroit were at least some of the time created by capitalists and outsourcing, so how can we take responsibility for systemic racism if capitalism and capitalists own that responsibility??
      - this is why I would rather appeal to the "labour bourgeoisie" and ways we're separated from solidarity by accepting capitalism; I feel that some of this systemic "Whiteness" problem could be solved by that
  - other civil rights struggles have a nasty tendency to think they're entirely separate from capitalism, such that people will go campaign for trans rights everywhere but work and then fully accept being misgendered at work to 'deserve' a Job, and decide it's plenty to find a limited circle of people who treats them better when they come home
    - the worst part is right-wingers still then decide that LGBT+ are busy waging civil rights struggles in workplaces from the bottom up when... they're not. capitalists are independently deciding to make their workplaces better because the struggle was carried out outside work and bled into work. but right-wingers are really convinced the workers are doing it or the general public is purposefully trying to "Woke!" workplaces and undermine capitalist power.
      - this really shows you how much capitalism is primarily about capitalist power over everyone else. if neoliberals lose the power to /use/ workplaces to enforce bigotry they get upset.
  - and of course... there was that time black America produced Identitarians.
    - Black Hammer: a small group of black nazis strangely obsessed with communist leaders, but likely not fully understanding them, tried to build a nationalist commune where neither jews nor racists were allowed but /white black-nationalists/ were maybe okay.
    - this event is quite easy to understand if you understand what Identitarianism and Duginism are. but many people just don't, and got more scared about it being "bad optics that will destroy Liberal anti-racism" than they needed to
  - to say it frankly: if black Americans have not taken up the concept of wage slavery and begun talking about it like wage workers and descendants of slaves are two branches of the same thing (class society) that should inherently find solidary with each other, shouldn't we re-evaluate it?

here's what I think is more accurate about "wage slavery", based on my analysis of the general ideas of competition and Markets:
capitalism is /not/ slavery to employers.
if we want to think of it as slavery (despite the flaws in that), it is /slavery to one's self/ where the individual "captures and uses" the self.

I think we can observe this in the conflict between Lacanianism and any real social problem.
- in Freudian ideas, we see human development modelled as a "superego" or "Symbolic" assuming responsible control of a human mind. 
- but this model was created within capitalism without thinking about the influence of capitalism on human development.
  - Lacanians would like to tell us a simple story about how a baby learns to talk and learns social knowledge and metaphors and models from parents and relatives, and over time develops into a functional adult capable of assuming the position of Mom or Dad and restarting the cycle of parenting.
  - however, capitalism rudely inserts itself into the middle of human development. a baby learns to talk and learns social models, and then before long has to /learn capitalism/ and learn to depend on functioning in a corporate environment or some workplace in order to live.
  - people in the United States often model human development as necessarily containing a stage where people "get their own house" and move away from parents, and capitalism becomes a greater priority than family or friends. where is that in Freudian models??
    - alternatively, they visualise a stage where people "start a business" and this likely becomes their social environment where they try to force on employees notions of a fake 'corporate family'. just as the boss was moved from social life into business life, so with everybody.
- subsequently, Lacanians get upset that "Foucault is so popular", which conceals some interesting revelations.
  - one thing Foucault wrote about was how society pathologises anyone that won't fit into capitalism and tells them there's something wrong with them rather than society. his example for how "power is everywhere" (or one of them) was society collectively tossing people into mental institutions when it wasn't convenient to integrate them into society and try to treat them.
  - however some Lacanians quickly missed the point of what Foucault was saying by getting confused about how you could resist a toxic society without individuals, who in this example would be the mentally ill people that have problems making their own decisions, individually finding ways to resist in the same way any healthy person would.
    - here we can see how Lacanianism has trouble thinking about whole structures and emergent effects within society instead of just the actions of individual people, and perhaps how those actions "generate" the structure.
- I would posit that Lacanians haven't understood how the Liberal vision of individualism is harmful to human beings and creates psychological damage, and /perhaps/ have accidentally baked that damage into their model of "normal development" without intending to.

so, capitalism is "slavery" where the individual captures and subjugates the self using Individualism.
first people are spaced apart into the smallest feasible social units which are each "responsible for themselves only",
then they experience a "society" where they are told that only sufficient individual discipline will create their survival, but they must also sell this individual discipline (work, qualification for a Capitalist Job position, a Finished Product, etc) to somebody who is actually willing to take it.
but this "buyer" is always terribly hard to find, creating serious pressure on people to constantly question and re-evaluate how they must behave and discipline themselves to successfully please the Market and receive a Capitalist Income.
this whole idea is hidden behind a bunch of nice-sounding phrases like "self-discipline", "initiative", "leadership", "21st century skills" / "job skills", "hard work" ("I got here to owning a business or becoming a bourgeois politician through Hard Work"), "social mobility", and many others.
- people are constantly sold the idea that everyone who succeeds in capitalism actually succeeded because they had one of these various positive-sounding words and didn't just miraculously slip through a hugely inefficient system where many people never get connected with "buyers" and are left discarding whatever ideas or practical services they had to sell.
- the surest way to see that this is true is to read a book about "teaching autistic people life skills" and read the part about getting a job.
  - if you read something like this, you'll see it's no more than the author literally trying to start from the beginning and explain what the hell capitalism is to somebody who doesn't understand. and inevitably failing to successfully convince somebody who genuinely has problems with capitalism

in this way it's kind of like there should be a fourth stage to Freudian models where we develop Self-Slavery in guise of "self-discipline".
we go through various disappointments in life and we either "selfishly" rebel trying to protect what makes us happy and/or healthy, or we accept that we must drastically modify ourselves to behave within the surprisingly narrow range of behaviors that exist in our current social systems if we would like to remain alive.
- so:
  - in the Real phase we passively observe reality,
  - in the Imaginary phase we come to recognise human individuals such as ourselves as coherent entities,  [*hc]
  - in the Symbolic phase we have to accept the separation between minds bridged by imperfect methods of communication, as awkward as it can be to not have what we want,
  - and in the fourth "Economic" phase we have to accept that the compromises we make to have an economy are really stupid and often against our own physical and mental health but we can't escape the conflict between obeying this to be alive and disobeying it to be healthy
- you could say that this "fourth Freudian stage" exists both in capitalism and in workers' states; so-called "Stalinist" oppression is really a conflict between the health of individuals and attempting to build a cooperative society where people consolidate onto the same broad objectives.
  - individual health can be affected by such things as: difficulty of getting food or other supplies, long working hours, lack of social support when people have to be moved around, unnecessary enforcement of reactionary social attitudes that carried over from the past, "mistakes" in law enforcement where people fear the wrong people will be sentenced
  - anarchist experiments have these too; in the time of the CNT people found themselves under harsh judgement by individual anarchist collectives if they weren't physically capable of doing enough work, and were sometimes turned away
  - several of these things happen due to external factors the workers' state did not really cause, but the human mind still has difficulty living through them. and that's all that's important right here — that they cause psychological distress causing the individual to doubt if society "is worth it"
- this is the closest I've ever gotten to finding Freudian models reasonable, yet that's only because I extended their model and made up a new concept I never saw them say before.

if we use this notion of "wage slavery" as Self-Slavery there is much less of a problem applying it to black Americans.
- back in the 1800s, slavery is formally ended, but "freedmen" often started out poor   [*ka]
  - sharecroppers had extra terms put on them by landlords thanks to the Black Codes that almost made them a bit like serfs. the closest thing in the United States anyway
  - other families had to send mothers to work whether they wanted to be housewives just to pay the bills
- a few people like early R&B musicians rise out of poverty by developing some particular novel Product for the Market and happening to be able to sell it to people
  - if I remember right, it takes time for some of these musicians to be more widely accepted even after they have been successfully selling records.
  - either way, people turn this around into a story of how capitalism is okay because you "just need to find your niche" or anyone who works ridiculously hard can sort of have an existence so it must be fine to wish that on everybody
    - although doing musical tours can be very physically demanding and musicians in general often ended up doing drugs just to get through it
  - the United States ran with the idea that musicians created their own careers working hard, but looking at the whole system, musicians used themselves just to get by, and sold their work to record companies, while record companies were allowed to treat the musicians like private property and skim off however much money before paying any back, and collect money on recordings after performers were dead
    - you are always told that it's too hard to successfully be a musician, but being a record company has always been a great career for capitalists to make more money off people.
- the United States as a whole has repeatedly tried to take away racial integration and take away education funding and take away all kinds of things, and then continues to pressure people to behave exactly and precisely the way white people want in this highly controlling way just to let them be part of society
  - see: studies where the same résumés get rejected just for having a "black name", excessive obsession with standard English grammar rules /all the time/ just so you can be prepared for that one moment you need to show that black colloquialisms are "dumb", times people get told that you have to unnaturally straighten your hair to be "professional"
  - Obama gets elected and people act like if he wasn't the best president ever he shouldn't be allowed to be paraded around as the first black president
  - aside: the end of Reconstruction really gives you insight into why the United States is so afraid of Bolshevism.
    - Reconstruction sounds strangely like the "lighter" end of what communist revolutions did in some countries. it built schools and universities, it gave people legal equality and new opportunities, it created some government bureaus, it supervised the Confederate states with the Liberal central government army. practically Stalin!
    - I can't believe that one of the reasons the United States hates Stalin and Hoxha is actually that we /hate schools/ and can't stand them having funding. one of the dumbest reasons and yet it's true!
- we put power behind racism (all of it) through vilifying poor neighbourhoods for not bootstrapping themselves and all becoming The Bourgeoisie as the whole population supposedly goes through that process
  - from this angle, the criticism that "giving extra help to a particular race is racist! you aren't appreciating the power of human talent!" falls away, because we are not asserting that poor neighbourhoods need help /because they are a certain race/ or /because they have certain ancestors/, but purely because the idea of being born in a "poor neighbourhood" genuinely devoid of opportunity is unnecessary for anyone and there's no reason we should let it continue.
- in summary, the more we push people out of society for dumb reasons the more likely they are to be poor, but the more people are poor, the more the United States simply hates them /more/ and pressures them to "work hard" and prove themselves by selling something to the Market to successfully attain petty-bourgeois / "labour bourgeois" status.
  - or, we excuse people from various kinds of bigotry /only/ if they thoroughly subjugate themselves to themselves and sell themselves to capitalism in order to prove themselves.

- thinking about it a little more: although "wage slavery to employers" is nonsense, it would be closer to an argument to say the United States never truly ended indentured servitude
  - exit fees are like a kind of indentured servitude you get for being born. were you born? here's your contract to pay off in capitalism, then you're free
  - when slaves were freed we kind of just handed them indentured servitude with things like sharecropping. generate a certain amount of value for white landowners or capitalists, then you're actually free
    - initial white settlers that were more in the working class had the first indentured servitude contracts, then we did this.
  - though later on we built up a system where either you pay your exit fees or we ultimately toss you into prison and turn you into a prison slave
    - but we try to claim prison slavery isn't about racism because it's "equal opportunity" — even a white person can get arrested for drugs and turned into a prison slave! equal-opportunity prison slavery. land of the free, home of the brave
  - we think Bolshevism is so evil because the Bolsheviks assigned people to jobs, but our civilisation was basically built through these indentured servitude contracts where you "voluntarily" sign a contract to somebody to receive Life and your parents had to sign a contract for you to be born holding your own partially-complete contract. no contract, no kid
    - we sign contracts just to exist and then corporations have the nerve to put contracts on paying customers to use their services, like certain kinds of Terms of Service and cell phone contracts where you have to pay for two years at a time or something
    - I guess in a sense one of the reasons we never have a Free Market is because The Bourgeoisie can always impose contracts on top of any of our choices
