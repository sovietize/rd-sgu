# gerrymandering or segregating workers


## Nests.

in trying to explain how it is the United States "is mostly proletarians" or in my model "is mostly a bunch of almost-proletarians who could easily flip over", yet still remains really resistant to organising,
I've sometimes used the term "Fascist Nests" to describe a social structure where people who are actually receptive to left-wing or even Marxist ideas are born into the middle of a vast sea of right-wingers who are all resistant to the slightest suggestion of anything new or anticapitalist. every person who can organise is surrounded on all sides by tens of "stupid people" who won't.
- here's how it goes: without any Marxism or history you try to describe one simple way to improve society, and the conservatives or centre-Liberals say, "okay but first you need to get an Income by Any Means Necessary"
  - "I think we have all the jobs we need and there are no jobs for me so I want to innovate" "haha that's funny, go subjugate yourself to some capitalist doing busy work or else die" "but I may never produce my innovation, how is that life even worth living" "you must not understand Life? you live it just to live it. nobody has to innovate :(" "what if I have dreams. you know, what if I want to Be something when I Grow Up as everybody always says" "I don't understand what you're talking about, I'm not sure that even exists"

now I've come to see this phenomemon as more like "Bourgeois Nests",
where Additional Bourgeois Classes help at least partly explain why they behave the way they do — and why they don't seem to give way to even moderate social-democrat organising for "all the reforms we can get".
I've also taken to just calling them Nests for short.

more characteristics of Nests:
- Nests are not precisely a material thing but more a set of social relationships formed on top of material life
- however each one does likely sit on a particular physical area, since people's social relationships are often affected by geography.
  - Nests go along with the phenomenon of the United States neatly segregating out All Bourgeoisie into one area and All proletarians out of that area.
  - Additional Bourgeoisie become like a tool to convince people the neighbourhood hasn't been selected specifically to be bourgeois. look, workers are born here all the time! and any of them can Start a Business and become the petty bourgeoisie! those are totally workers and not the microbourgeoisie, what does that even mean?
- gentrification is a subset of the greater Nest phenomenon with a more racist focus. in it people semi-intentionally build a Nest of the kind of people they want to live next to, whether they think it's to escape 'poor people culture' or simply non-white people period.
- the Nest could also form itself around an ideological faction, as more people decide they dislike the ideologies people have in other areas and move out of those areas into others.
  - conservatives may believe the city is too centre and they need to go form their own Nest, while privileged centre-Liberals in the city may also form a separate centre-Liberal Nest.
- one promising thing is that some people are genuinely upset about the kind of life you get within Nests, even if they qualify as Additional Bourgeoisie.
  - they may be very confused on the actual reasons they're stuck in this kind of life, to the point they can't truly challenge capitalism or Nests in any way. but they certainly don't like it.
- as an "ideological" phenomenon, Nests most likely have material factors underlying why they form and why people would decide to form them instead of not doing that.

why is it that Nests probably happen?
well, I came up with the idea of Nests because I grew up in a suburb and had a very hard time 'launching' out of it in any way. I felt like I was stuck in a nasty little "nest" of things that thwarted me from getting out.
here is what I see materially happening to create the physical place I grew up:

- jobs and employers centralise into cities and towns
- people (Liberals) won't fight capitalism so they simply let jobs drift to whatever capitalists, and capitalists locate themselves wherever they want to
  - some people will defend this layout as "better than the alternatives" and say it's fine for it to be baked into zoning codes so nothing else is allowed.
- we end up with a layout where there is a town full of actual economic activity, and big swaths of suburbs that produce basically nothing
- whole generations of people grow up in an area where inherently there is nothing for them to produce in capitalism and they are just surplus people; it costs at least US $4,000 for them to become proletarians, so they have almost no choice but to be lumpenbourgeoisie
  - the $4,000 may be the cost of an extra car, a university degree, a living space, etc.
  - in any case, it's the cost to get out of the physical Nest area or to convince an employer to hand out a job, or both; maybe for some people it will be $8,000.
  - maybe for some people it's $4,000 house/car, $4,000 degree, $4,000 psychotherapy to have any will to live or work. and even all that may not be enough to get them out quite yet.
- some people will manage to fit into the social environment of the Nest, and cooperate with its other inhabitants to scrape together the $4,000 exit fee and become proletarians
  - perhaps the Nest is very right-wing, and they blend in by being a bigoted conservative, or maybe they luck out and get a centre-Liberal Nest and blend in by not questioning the US Democratic party
- other people will find it difficult to successfully find anyone to take their exit fee, and find that aiming to become petty-bourgeois is easier
  - this may include things like YouTube channels, patreon, running an ebay shop, art commissions, becoming a "grifter" and selling political but useless books
  - art commissions, for instance, could actually vary from proletarian-for-hire to petty-bourgeois depending. this is one of the situations where it makes the most sense to just label them "microbourgeoisie" and say they need to be connected to some kind of currently-vaguely-defined "collective structure for proletarianisation" in the future and call it good.

- physically and spatially, Nests are a place where there are a bunch of /people/ to go through but no jobs. they are like a 'job desert', or a saltwater ocean with no good water and all the water-boiling islands very far away
  - in the past, when there were serfs on manors or even farm capitalists, people depended on some maybe-modified form of nature to survive... but now we've arranged things to where we depend on /people/ to be allowed to reach other people who then possess tools of survival.
  - it's easy to see how people are prevented from becoming class-conscious if there are literally a bunch of people standing between them and work who they have to ask "do I have permission to work?", and any of those people could be corrupt and decide to make it harder.

this may open up the possibility that if the United States wanted to have a 'traditional' workers' movement as has happened anywhere else,
it could be done by proletarians calling a general strike AND everyone who has failed to make it to the proletariat /refusing to pay exit fees/. I won't buy a car, I won't pay a university, I won't satisfy a capitalist to land a job, but I will join the strike, or attempt to create non-capitalist workplaces in which to put everybody who won't pay exit fees (which must be able to directly substitute for local capitalist services at least a little bit). if these workplaces come to exist they will be the only ones open.
the only real way to give exit fees no power is to make sure everybody can get into work without paying them, so everyone can get into work /immediately/ and throw a rude gesture to the concept of "unemployment". but this is very difficult without proletarian movements either /paying the exit fee/ (!) or /abolishing capitalists/.
so it may be that a refusal of exit fees could literally only happen as part of a revolution.


## "Cultural Marxism" conspiracy theory as reversed Marxism

United States fascism basically believes that
1. it must turn everyone into the bourgeoisie, no matter how micro- of bourgeoisie they end up as
2. the United States is the best country on earth — this being an axiom — so it deserves to be a civilisation of entirely bourgeoisie, even if that results in other countries having to be a civilisation of workers, even if other countries should be conquered or die
3. all "successful" civilisations should become bourgeois civilisations that turn everybody into the bourgeoisie, everything else is savagery

it's very easy to derive every idea in US fascism starting with just the idea everyone in the United States should be the bourgeoisie and anybody that isn't is some kind of aberration or enemy.
in this way it resembles a kind of "reversed Marxism" where bourgeoisie are good and proletarians are bad and you had better not interact with any proletarians or proletarian ideology or you undermine the whole existence of the United States.
(or, you could say the United States is constructed as one gigantic, country-sized Bourgeois Nest.)

this in my mind is the connecting thread between entirely centre ideologies with no content and "encouraging fascism".
it is not that Joe Biden is blatantly fascist or Liberalism is blatantly fascist as much as that US fascism neatly dovetails into the current class structure of the United States (and the spatial layout of classes) and the system will naturally evolve to fascism if you don't /challenge it/ and at least unseat the petty- and microbourgeoisie.


## exit fees expose changing nature of capitalism

a saying that goes around among US communists in various forms is,
"the interests of capitalists and workers are diametrically opposed: the capitalist wants to profit as much as possible, you want to keep as much of your wages as possible".

but with a dialectical understanding of the world — understanding the concept that two interacting elements of society can change themselves and their relationship as they interact —
it should not be hard to conceive that the relationship in this "saying" can actually /change over time/ and /get even worse/ to the point we have entirely new "sayings".

I think the "saying" of the 2020s should be more like:
"workers want to produce value that somehow translates into value they can use in their life; capitalists want to snatch and control /all the value in the economy/ such that every material action you take in your life (if it's big enough) requires asking permission from The Bourgeoisie".

this is about what we arrive at if we combine our understandings of "Tivoization" and exit fees.
1. in capitalist control of consumer products, we see corporations convince everyone that they don't actually want control over their own life because the convenience of having something already done at a corporation is 'better' or 'more practical' than having any say in how it was done. thus handing the Bourgeoisie more of material life to deliver to us by siloing up more workers
2. with exit fees, we see a mechanism where corporations make us outright ask permission to be in the workforce, from them plus every part of society that isn't fervently against them as one big group.

here is the struggle faced by United States workers in 2020:
- the worker wants a "job", defined as an activity where they can produce value in order to support their life.
- the worker is offered only Capitalist Jobs
- the Capitalist Jobs are often terribly inaccessible, far away from the worker's physical area
  - corporations campaign against public transit to avoid paying taxes, so no usable public transit is created
  - in exchange for no public transit taxes, every household is charged an exit fee of buying a $4,000 car for every person who wants to be out of the house simultaneously
  - as well as a $70-$200 licence and a period of learning to drive up to 2 years, depending on how many testing attempts it takes
- Capitalist Jobs always separate 'useful' workers from surplus workers through job interviews, creating a limited number of Capitalist Job slots but also the illusion that every Job is "more competitive"
  - this phenomenon is well known already, people already talk about a 'reserve army of unemployed'
  - here another dubious exit fee is created, the $4,000 university degree that *maybe* bumps people up closer to a vacant Capitalist Job slot or may actually not
  - either way the degree is a seal of approval that you are allowed to have worth to your family or community, and /look/ like somebody who deserves to get into a Capitalist Job slot
    - in some ways the purpose of a degree may be to layer on further exit fees:
    - if you get a gender studies degree you're evil so you'd better pay the exit fee of changing your major and getting a better degree if you want to get into society and the Capitalist Job Market
    - if you're from a poor neighbourhood, pay for a Good Degree /and/ get debt to pay it /and/ pay for all the other stuff you need in order to get there
- the best-quality resistance could be had by getting /into work/ but many productive and smart people are not allowed to get into work.
  - thus, it doesn't make sense to resist capitalism by refusing to find employment. this is refusing to struggle. advancing struggle would be tossing more people into work than are usually allowed
  - when people are trapped by unemployment and exit fees it's hard to meet with organisations because they're physically isolated from any possible meeting places.
    - technically it's now easier to have digital meetings, but if you're physically isolated from other people it's still very hard to make connections and /find/ groups to meet with.
- thus many workers are stuck outside of Capitalism Proper and also /outside of resistance/.
  - this is why I believe we need to conceptualise people out of work as somehow outside of the proletariat and struggling to get into the proletariat.
  - I proposed the lumpenbourgeoisie + lumpenproletariat juxtaposed with the proletariat, but this is the real core of it. we have /outside the proletariat/ and /inside the proletariat/, and we want to get people /in/.

- when people outside of Capitalism Proper try to advocate to workers inside it they often don't listen and behave as if merely /having/ a Capitalist Job has made everything okay and bought them off
  - there is a critical lack of empathy from employed workers to everybody else.
  - and dangerously so; employed workers make decisions against /their own best interests/ as well as yours
  - in other contexts some people have tried to explain workers blinded by privilege with the idea of the "labour aristocracy" but I don't think that's sufficient. I think we may have to conceptualise a labour /bourgeoisie/ that has been assimilated into Bourgeois Production as an instrument of defending Everything about material life belonging to The Bourgeoisie. ('microbourgeoisie')
- the final blow comes with consumer products. if you try to advocate anything around improving consumer products people fall into complete consumerism and act like Products or Services are always 'take it or leave it' and there is not truly any such thing as consumers having ideas to improve them
  - infuriatingly people still go on and on about their ideas to improve Products on "social media" platforms, unaware that this just represents them selling the Product of discontentment to other viewers on the platform's "Algorithmic" Market, fully complementary with the original Product
    - their Product of discontentment is also subject to neoliberal economic regulation. if the people in charge of Bourgeois Production for a given Product don't like reviews or fan works, they can suppress any or all of them.

- in theory one might be able to escape the control of Bourgeois Production over one media series or general 'product that is talked about on newsfeed platforms' by creating a new anticapitalist product and agitating against all Bourgeois Production and Products controlled by it.
  - however, this is difficult to pull off because many people are much too stuck in competitive market thinking where they think Bourgeois Products are complementary to the agitation effort unless it can literally outcompete the capitalist counterpart and make it obsolete.
  - from another angle, the society of the United States operates with a kind of "Entireness". people form somewhat-coherent networks of people and want to keep the coherent network together no matter who controls it.
    - so, they casually let Facebook control it or Twitter control it because they are so dead-set on staying in the same network and maintaining the same expected set of relationships, such as an artist getting onto the Entire network and marketing art commissions to a newsfeed in a very specific way, or far-righters getting onto the Entire network and expecting they get to spout the same bigotry as always, or family members or small friend groups using whatever service other members use even if it's going to change hands or change drastically.
  - in this way it's as if capitalists buy control over social territories people already exist in, rather than people freely choosing to be in those 'territories'.
    - it's as if we imagine France existed and then (perhaps because its economy was faltering just a little) a capitalist came and bought all of France, while everyone apathetically accepted it except a few people who were upset enough to move to Spain.
  - ultimately, it appears that it's totally necessary to /overthrow capitalism/ in existing networks of human beings and institute economic democracy on /what's already there/ in order to free those people from capitalism. otherwise capitalism simply takes over those territories more effectively than anything else, and the combined unit of Bourgeois Production and the social territory resists any change.

- the end result of the hold of Bourgeois Production + "Tivoization" + social Entireness + Capitalist Job slots + exit fees is: there is almost a phenomenon of "society slots" where there is a gate to get into society and some people are stuck outside the gate.
  - however, getting past the gate is not even worth it! you almost make your life /worse/ by entering.
  - capitalism tells you you're all kinds of negative things if you can't enter the Gate Into Capitalism. however, if you enter the gate, it puts you into a job so you can /take away others' freedom/. (while also sacrificing your own.)
- workers simply want a job in order to create value so they will have use-value to use in their own life. but the Gate Into Capitalism prohibits them from even creating value for society.
  - this is one of the fatal flaws in the concept of "The Free Market". it assumes everyone is part of society and equally able to participate in the economy, while somebody separated from the rest of society in some way has little or no ability to sell anything including on the "Job Market"
    - more generally, "Free Market" theories do not account for social factors like relationships or an individual's calculation of whether to try to live, while Marxism has the ability to explore the effect of social factors and psychological/biological aspects of human beings on the economy, if they become relevant
  - in this way capitalism functions like some kind of dam blocking the flow of people and slowly letting them in. whatever a person produces (whether innovation or practical job of choice) only has value because capitalism has allowed them into the gate and they have been shown a 'market' of people to which it has value.
    - I think I'm saying there's a social relationship dimension to value itself? I think I'm talking about exchange value and the exchange value of labour to society or something like that. I don't fully understand where this is going to be honest.   [*L]

- thus, being for abolishing capitalism in the United States does not start you in a position of control. it starts you in a disadvantaged position of requiring 'permission' from each human being to make any more progress on organising anyone or simply to present new uncommon ideas
  - it's easy to think from an anarchist-style perspective that the moment you decide to resist capitalism you instantly remove a bit of capitalist control over your life. but that's far from enough to make you able to accomplish anything
  - at some moments it can even feel like all ethical rules have been removed and you need a whole different set of explanations for why /communists/ deserve life, or good jobs, or the right to participate in decisions that affect their life and the lives of others, etc, that you don't yet have handy
    - if Liberals go read the 1848 Communist Manifesto as if that's supposed to be meaningful, it's easy for them to think, "well that's your movement's bill of rights, and I have my bill of rights. make everyone vote for Greg Bists and drop communist parties or you'll have No rights"
    - but inside that is an implied, "because how can communists Build anything and outcompete my boss?? until you build a new economy, I will not consider a revolution possible".
  - and so it's like if you are demanding any social rights you must prove yourself. you must prove your ideas in order to be listened to, while first proving you should be allowed to live to capitalist employers or whoever it may be

another slogan US communists have said for some time is,
"the proletariat has the ability to create change not because it is 'oppressed' but because it creates value".
this one is still half good, but we should probably examine the second half.

something unclear but very important has happened to the creation of value in the US economy.
- employed workers clearly still exist, but many people are blocked from work by exit fees, the Capitalist Job Interview process, etc.
- a number of industries are profiting from exit fees — cars, credit cards, private universities, private driving instructors, mental health (maybe private healthcare in general), mortgages, renters
  - in previous decades we simply thought of these things as part of life, but at some point there was a shift where they became /the cost to get a Job/.
- there was the whole "subprime mortgage bubble" where big investors gambled on the US economy doing so well everyone who was not really expected to pay back mortgages would spontaneously be able to pay back mortgages. which didn't work of course   [*mbs]
  - this event makes me ask: when the economy relies that much on ridiculous growth why are there also exit fees?
  - exit fees would appear to hamper economic growth by creating adult people who consume more value than they can put back into capitalism — in my local area it's maybe 2 lumpens for every 1 worker
  - of course, in some situations like WWI, a few countries simply saw their entire economy collapse as nobody could pay back anything to anyone else. evidence that the subprime mortgage crisis was /not/ any kind of interesting master plan
  - 'simple' exit fees like cars or degrees equal more working hours and revenue at a business
  - exit fees involving debt are more complex. if you manage to get a $4,000 loan in order to exit, the 'revenue' off the loan is small. there will only be a notable 'profit' if you take very long to pay it back and the bank collected a lot of interest
    - which... wait. were these subprime mortgages... profitable? if you sell the mortgage then "somebody" past the buying end accumulates all the payments including the interest
    - that means the best 'deal' on a MBS is that people do pay it back but they pay it back over a long time for the maximum amount of interest (or you just buy the highest-interest slices, apparently)
  - there may be a scenario where exit fees conceivably create more profits for lenders.
  - but lenders don't actually create anything.

- maybe the simplest mathematical hypothesis is just that employees exploit lumpens.
  - an employed worker generates a certain amount of value, of which the employer will take a cut
  - however, the exchange value of the worker's labour is affected by how many workers there are, because it is affected by how many of some hypothetical Finished Product there are
  - if this is true, employees benefit from fewer people in a given industry/monopoly.
    - usually you wouldn't notice this because it's /bosses/ that decide there are too many workers.
    - however, this would begin to explain the problem in some industries where men are upset women are getting in, or LGBT+, etc. if revenue drops, both could lose more wages, or the man could get laid off instead of the woman
      - "they're keeping Gender Ideologists and firing all the transphobes!!" maybe they are. but maybe that's entirely an artefact of intentionally preserving late-stage capitalism, where workers compete against each other for Job Slots just to preserve their own paycheck.
  - man, if this hypothesis is true... we've really done this to ourselves.
    - the US Democratic Party voting bloc is basically the party of, let's make sure all the people who might be experiencing bigotry get into Capitalist Jobs and all the nasty people get fired. we'll preserve capitalism entirely so it can fund the bourgeois parties but we'll let it turn into a Different form of social control so all the people who would use capitalism to twist the government and take away rights are gradually kicked out of Capitalism Proper and only the 'leftist menace' is allowed through the gate
    - right-wing arguments that the left-leaning menace is taking over everything would be halfway to having a point because they're currently the only ones complaining about employed workers exploiting people who get fired or not hired, while everybody else is unaware of the problem.
      - but you also can't simply enable the right-wingers as if they're honestly fighting capitalism, because their ideology is always Entire, it's always an iceberg of much nastier stuff
      - even trying to flip them over to Marxism is risky because you may end up with an Identitarian that claims to be a huge fan of communist leaders but has a half-intact Entire right-wing ideology.
  - what would we do to fix this? if you just removed the capitalists and pumped in the lumpens wages might crash or something. there might be some kind of shock to the economy where wages or prices were messed up because we always relied on "The Free Market" to determine what Jobs would exist for the workers to work in
    - funny that the reason supposedly "communism doesn't work!" is not the reason you think. the problem is we previously couldn't pay everyone a wage /period/
    - this is how the Bolsheviks got through the crash. there already was a crash, then they simply went 'eh' about paying anybody any specific compensation until there was something to pay people. and then they mysteriously had full employment

I thought I'd end up very confused but I might have solved the question?
capitalism requires /three/ classes, the proletariat, bourgeoisie, and /lumpenproletariat/, and one of the critical moments in passing to postcapitalism is eliminating the tension between the lumpenproletariat and the other two, although it's not necessarily something you do to "cause" the transition.





[*L] this has a bizarre resemblance to the Lacanians' idea of having to understand relationships through the "split subject" and its division between real person and spoken message — we have the real person with the use value of their real productivity, and then we have exchange value being affected by social relationships, separated from the real person.
although it's like I've accidentally taken and made the "split subject" idea /much more material/ and rooted in particular concrete things such that it could finally have a chance of having some validity or at least becoming testable.
