I listened to this Dengist channel where whatsisname was describing how there had to be strict control of government officials to prevent the chinese government from falling apart
trotskyists might find this frightening and feel like it was "Stalinism" that would tear apart governments because nobody would have the guts to go into government
but really it sounds more like a description of an effective democratic republic
Stalin as well tended to actually be upholding democracy and what the workers wanted when he tried to keep the government accountable to the people and what had been decided

i honestly /hope/ the Dengists are correct on this one subject of democracy
because if they're not, the implications are really troubling

it's as if the entire idea of democratic republics has been eroding as groups of people collectively decided they hated democracy at least in this form,
and "Stalinists" are the only ones who have been trying to /preserve/ the democratic republic into the 2020s

the United States saw the democratic republic slip away as several things about it became unaccountable â€” capitalists, structures in bourgeois parties, access to voting, peaceful transfer of power, most notably the whole belief that a republic is cooperative and about listening rather than competitive and about taking power

however, the structure of "the trump cult" is eerily similar on its surface to the Trotskyite conspiracy of the 1930s
both of them were kinda these hidden networks of miscellaneous people who didn't actually need to be held to any standard to join
both rejected democracy and acted like democratic decisions were illegitimate and needed to be overthrown
both of them would be pushed away by beliefs that the institutions of the central government were legitimate and the conspirators were traitors to the country that didn't even need to be listened to.
although a whole lot of people were unsatisfied with that reasoning and felt like you could use much stronger reasoning to defeat the conspirators' bad ideas than what looks like "because I said so". in the time of the Trotskyite conspiracy, this was people talking about soviet democracy and trying to find better ways to do Marxist policy than what Stalin's government did. in the time of the "trump cult" this is various people saying the problem that led to the attack on democracy is Liberalism and we need Marxism-Leninism

you can see the slight contradiction. people think Marxism-Leninism or Trotskyism will fix the problem that led to the attack on democracy, but it seems like we've been through this before. it seems like you establish a Leninist democratic republic and the same thing happens.

if the Dengists are right, it's good news. democratic republics are not obsolete and you really just have to hold them accountable
if the Dengists are wrong, it's really bad news. democratic republics became obsolete some time around 1940 and we've been hanging onto them with a false belief that they just need to be fixed and maintained rather than thrown out the window. there's something fundamentally wrong with the entire idea of nation-states or holding people together in a huge territory like the US or China under a particular democratic party and government with particular democratic decisions.


if the Dengists are wrong, what might the correct thing look like?
well, we should be very worried because it will be much more difficult to figure out than finding the correct Leninist way would have been if that were the most viable way.
people breaking off the public sector into independent businesses during China's reforms into a "socialist market economy" would be a critical step in the transition out of the democratic republic
but it would be critical /because/ the civilization was separating into smaller units
civilization turning into small circuits of civilization where individuals exist atop an oddly-specific business and don't have to think much about other individuals and only their paycheck would be an integral if small part of a socialist transition
