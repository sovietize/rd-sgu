# formation of bonds as agreement

disagreement is not harmless
it should be taken as a warning sign

if we disagree on small points and are willing to have a civil discussion, this is not a problem, and we can enrich each other with new understandings

but if we ""disagree"" on everything, it's very easy to stop being friends / family members / allies

if we want to build a household, or a business, or a political party, or a country, we must agree on /something/ or the thing will crumble apart as people fail to cooperate

social bonds are formed through at least some kind of agreement
and if all the agreements fracture, the bond will be broken


the Chinese idea of attempting to coordinate everybody together into some kind of agreement is honestly more productive than the American idea of everyone always being entitled to "disagree"

"i disagree with america" can get us a civil rights protest.... or sometimes an angry nazi protest against modernity and immigrants
but it can't really get us organized into enduring mass organizations because this requires a widely increasing network of agreements


remember:
if Trotsky "disagrees" with everything about the republic, he will destroy the republic
the only way to stop him is to find something he actually agrees with and doesn't want to throw away for some greater priority



in short the building block that lies under economic and political projects is affinity - forming an agreement between individuals or groups of people

an implication of this is that you can't organize an entire country together around an identity cause such as transgender rights or even anti-racism - a mistake commonly made by Liberals
you can organize together groups of a certain limited size, but then those identity/ally groups must reach out to other groups on a completely different issue that both groups have an affinity on
if successful, a scattered bunch of groups or causes can build a tightly woven fabric of many separate agreements passing through the whole thing and overall become harder to pull apart

maybe it really is the case the Democratic Party is the United States' leading LGBT organization.
if so, smaller-scale Democrat voter groups - not to be confused with the party or entire voter base - must join themselves with economic organizations on an issue they both have an affinity on, so that the new emergent group will have both issues


this is the true meaning and implementation of Interfactionalism, I think.
it's several groups for different causes joining together on an affinity issue they do not want to throw away



for much of human history you had to force people together into fake affinities to get them to cooperate and get things done, and this is why we invented class societies such as kingdoms and bourgeois nation-states

you're all part of the same nation, so cooperate, you totally agreed to the social contract the bourgeoisie formulated, we would tell people. you agreed to the christian bible and the religious hierarchy by being born. you agreed to patriarchy by wanting to have a baby, so put up with it. you agreed to racism or xenophobia or islamophobia by wanting to have a job and not leave the country.



the affinity model kind of just matches what has always been said about "ideological struggle" in organizations
however, I think it is a more dialectical-materialist way to explain things.

in the united states we have a giant problem that if you try to explain anything with historical anecdotes about civil rights struggles, the Bolsheviks or the Paris Commune, whatever, a lot of people will not find it relatable. they will not find themselves able to fully see those people as human beings and identify with them.

(which is strange when sometimes people will both reject a historical anecdote as unrelatable and claim an ancient bible story from a culture most of us haven't studied deeply and don't understand and whose values we have already left behind is completely universal. what's the difference?)

so presenting the idea of a structural model of affinity may be more effective
